# Overview
Native apps are applications developed only using the Greenfield SDK, without involving the development of smart contracts.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each native application, providing step-by-step guides, code snippets, and best practices to empower you to create powerful and innovative dApps without the need for smart contract development.

## Data Marketplace

Data marketplace is a data exchange platform where users can freely create, list, trade, and sell data assets, including digital publications, scientific experimental data, and specific domain data.

## Developing with smart contracts on BSC
One of the primary methods for building dApps with BNB Greenfield is by deploying smart contracts to the BSC. Smart contracts are self-executing programs that facilitate and enforce the execution of agreements without the need for intermediaries.
