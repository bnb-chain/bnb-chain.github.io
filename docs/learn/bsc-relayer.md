# BSC Relayer
Relayers are responsible for submitting Cross-Chain Communication Packages between the two blockchains. Due to the heterogeneous parallel chain structure, two different types of Relayers are created.

Relayers for BC-to-BSC communication referred to as **BSC Relayers** are a standalone process that can be run by anyone, and anywhere, except that Relayers must register themselves onto BSC and deposit a certain amount of BNB. Only relaying requests from the registered Relayers will be accepted by BSC.
