### Upgrade to opBNB Node v0.4.1 Before Hardfork

Attention opBNB node operators,

We are pleased to announce the release of opBNB node version 0.4.1. This update is critical and includes important features and improvements. All node operators are required to upgrade to this version before the upcoming hardfork.

### Key Highlight: EIP 7212 - secp256r1 Curve Precompile

One of the significant enhancements in this release is the introduction of a precompile for the secp256r1 curve, as specified in [EIP 7212](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7212). This precompile allows for efficient elliptic curve operations, which is crucial for improving the performance and security of cryptographic applications on the blockchain.
