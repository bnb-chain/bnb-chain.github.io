## Testnet Faucet

If you want to test the functionality of the BNB Smart Chain, you will need some testing tokens, such as tBNB and other major tokens like USDC, BUSD, DAI, and wrapped Bitcoin. There are two ways to claim these testing tokens. 
Please refer to the BSC [faucet doc](../../bnb-smart-chain/developers/faucet.md) for details. After you claim your tokens, you can transfer your testing assets to opBNB to start testing through [testnet bridge](https://opbnb-testnet-bridge.bnbchain.org).
