# Account Abstraction

## opBNB is a cost-efficient solution for AA 
The primary allure of opBNB lies in its ability to significantly reduce the gas costs associated with AA (ERC4337) transactions. This efficiency is achieved through optimized transaction processing and a more streamlined approach to handling complex operations typically found in AA transactions. AA transactions, with their intricate operations and smart contract interactions, traditionally require more computational resources. opBNB, however, utilizes innovative methods to simplify these processes, ensuring that the complexity does not translate into prohibitive costs for users and developers.

## Enhanced transaction speed with lower costs
Not only does opBNB address the cost issue, but it also offers higher Transaction Per Second (TPS) rates. This combination of low cost and high speed is particularly crucial for dApps that require both efficiency and scalability, making opBNB a ideal choice for High-Frequency DeFi and web3 games. By integrating opBNB, dApp developers can offer their users a seamless experience without the burden of high transaction fees. This user-friendly approach, coupled with cost-effective operations, positions opBNB as a preferred choice in the AA landscape.

## opBNB AA Infrastructure   

Notably, platforms like [Biconomy](https://docs.biconomy.io/supportedchains/) and [Particle Wallet](https://docs.particle.network/overview/available-networks) have already adopted opBNB's AA solutions. Their integration showcases the practical application and effectiveness of opBNB in managing the complexity and cost of AA transactions in real-world scenarios.
