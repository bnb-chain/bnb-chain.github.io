## Submit Tools on Developers Tool

[**Developers Tool**](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/dev-tools) is a developer tooling landscape which collects toolings for developers to build on BSC, opBNB and Greenfield. Contributions on this page will make developers find your project and integrate it in their work more easily.

**Steps to submit:**
1. Prepare basic information of your project: description, website, logo, supported chain, etc.
2. Choose the tag (e.g. Defi, AI, Game, etc) and Category (e.g. Wallet, Dex, Marketplace, etc) your project belongs to.
3. Submit the above information by raising a Github PR [**here**](https://github.com/bnb-chain/developer-tools-list). For more information, please refer to this [**Guide**](https://github.com/bnb-chain/developer-tools-list?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing).
