# Overview
In 2017, Binance and BNB were born. Three years later, BNB Smart Chain (BSC) was introduced to the world. As Binance grew bigger and stronger, so did BNB Smart Chain.  BSC was born in time for the DeFi revolution, as the public showed increased interest in alternative financial solutions and use cases powered by blockchain. Today, both Binance and BSC remain connected by BNB.

## Beyond Binance
BNB is more than just Binance. BNB has its own living, breathing ecosystem, together with BSC. The vision is that one day everyone will own BNB, and that’s why it’s necessary to set it free. For BNB to reach its true potential, Binance and BSC must set sail on different courses. From today, BNB Chain and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) become BNB Chain.

BSC development teams and community pioneers would like to share the outlook for the future development direction of the BNB blockchain ecosystem and to demonstrate the resilience and persistence of the BNB spirit: for the builders and users and target to onboard 1B users.

With this name change also comes more advancements to benefit users, projects and developers connected to the BNB Chain community. BNB Chain will embrace large-scale applications, including GameFi, SocialFi and the Metaverse. In particular:
- Scaling from one chain to multi-chain
- Boosting the throughput of BSC
- Introducing on-chain governance mechanisms
- Improving scaling solutions and an expansion of the validator set of BSC from 21 to 50 (with 29 validators functioning as candidate block producers)
