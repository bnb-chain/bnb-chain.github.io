title: Showcase - RWA Tokenization Tutorial
---

Welcome to the BNB Chain Real World Asset Tokenization Tutorial.

Real World Assets (RWA) in crypto involve tokenizing physical assets like real estate, receivables, and loans on blockchain.Tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) involves converting ownership rights of physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. It provides liquidity for your tangible assets and creates better cash flow for you. 

BNB Chain's multi-chain framework, including BSC, opBNB, and Greenfield, offers scalability, low costs, and secure data storage, making it ideal for Enterprises to start their Real World Asset  tokenization journey. 

It generally takes 4 steps to tokenize your real world asset: 

1) Asset Preparation

   1. Legal structuring
   2. Asset custody 
   
2) Account Preparation

   1. Setup Wallet
   2. Buy Crypto
   
3) Issue Token

4) Launch Token


There are plenty of tools and service providers in the BNB Chain ecosystem that can help you with the tokenization journey, we carefully select some of the best in our tutorial to guide you through the Web3 way. You can create your token in a few minutes with no coding or any blockchain knowledge. 

## 1 Asset Preparation
### 1.1 Legal Structuring

The asset tokenization journey begins with identifying an asset with strong tokenization potential, such as real estate, fine arts, commodities, and precious metals. Ensure that the asset is eligible for tokenization and complies with relevant regulations.

The value of the asset is then carefully assessed and documented, following standard financial practices.

At this step, a legal framework is established to ensure that digital tokens represent valid claims to the underlying real world assets. This involves defining the specific rights associated with the tokens and choosing an appropriate tokenization structure. ‍

Two common tokenization structures for real world assets 

The two common tokenization structures include Tokenized Special Purpose Vehicle (“SPV”) and Direct Asset Tokenization:

- **Tokenized SPV**: Tokenized SPV approach also known as indirect tokenization is a common approach where the asset is held by an entity, either a private limited company or a trust. This entity is then tokenized, and tokens are issued through a pooling of funds from multiple investors, giving investors indirect interests in the underlying RWA. This is often a better approach as it fits within the securities regulations.
- **Direct Asset Tokenization**: The asset itself is directly tokenized and the tokens represent a direct claim on the underlying asset This approach is typically less common due to regulatory challenges and issues such as non-fungibility, lack of regulatory clarity, and limited use cases. 

Each tokenization structure often comes with different licensing requirements.

### 1.2 Asset Custody 
Before digitalization, the underlying asset (RWA) will be custodized to ensure the asset is immobilized and safe kept before its digital representation is created on the blockchain. Most times if it's a tangible movable RWA like whiskey barrels the RWA is securely stored and managed by qualified custodians, trustees, or licensed managers. 

On the other hand, the digital representation i.e. RWA tokens can be either held in i) Self Custodized or ii) 3rd Party licensed custodian.

**Self-custody** 

Self-custody wallets are wallets used to store digital assets providing users full control over their private keys and, consequently, their assets. It is the practice of individuals taking full control and responsibility for storing and managing their own digital assets without relying on third-party intermediaries. 

With self-custody, users hold their own private keys, which are essential for accessing and transacting with their digital assets. Self-custody wallets, which can be software-based (like mobile or desktop applications) or hardware-based (physical devices), allow users to interact directly with blockchain networks, giving them complete ownership and control over their assets. 

While self-custody offers enhanced security and privacy, it also requires users to be vigilant about safeguarding their private keys and recovery phrases, as there is no central authority to recover lost or stolen assets. 

**Custodizing RWA Tokens with a Licensed 3rd Party Custodian**

Licensed Custodians are regulated and authorized to provide custody services. These custodians are typically subject to stringent regulatory requirements and oversight, ensuring they adhere to high standards of security, operational integrity, and compliance. By leveraging the services of a licensed digital asset custodian, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with holding and managing digital assets, ensuring they are stored securely and in compliance with relevant regulations. 

Some of the security measures adopted are decentralized security protocols and multi-party computation (MPC) to eliminate single points of failure, thereby enhancing the protection against both external and internal threats. Additionally, custodians often implement multi-signature wallets, hardware security modules (HSMs), and key sharding to further safeguard private keys. These technologies are complemented by rigorous compliance with regulatory standards, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, ensuring that custodians meet stringent reporting, auditing, and fraud detection requirements

There are many different types of assets in the world and how the custodian is handled and regulated is widely different. The issuers should evaluate the custodian's services, such as asset management, trade processing, and asset servicing, to ensure they meet the needs of the RWA.

3) Choose Defi Token, enter basic setting information

Here is how to set each parameter:

**Name:** This is ideally a human readable name such as "Real World Asset No. 001".

**Symbol**: The token symbol is comparable to its ticker symbol, typically four or more characters are used such as "RWA1".

**Initial supply**: The amount of tokens that get minted at token creation. Usually you will not increase the supply after token creation, so it will be the total supply of your token at all times. The supply is usually determined by the desired token denomination (i.e. the nominal value per token).

For example, for a bond offering with a nominal amount of USD 10 million and a denomination of USD 100,000 the supply would have to be 100 tokens.

**Decimals**: Values can be 0-18, when 0 is used, the token is not divisible. We suggest you set it as “**18**”.
