---

Welcome to the BNB Chain Tokenization Tutorial.

Tokenization is a process by which you create a digital token that can be traded on a blockchain. Tokenization has opened up a new way for businesses to create new revenue streams and help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to access funding and grow their businesses.

BNB Chain's multi-chain framework, including BSC, opBNB, and Greenfield, offers scalability, low costs, and secure data storage, making it ideal for SMEs to start their tokenization journey. 

It generally takes 4 steps to tokenize your company: 

1) Preparation  

   1. Setup Wallet  
   2. Buy Crypto  

2) Token Launch  

   1. Create Token  
   2. Presale  

3) Withdrawal  

4) Reward Distribution

## 1 Preparation

Go to [Account Preparation Tutorial](./account-preparation.md) to get prepared before starting your tokenization journey. 

## 2 Token Launch

After all the preparation work, you are now ready to create your token. 

### 2.1 Create Token

To create a token, you only need to configure a few basic parameters. 

We suggest these two service providers since they provide one-stop service with rich features:

- PinkSale (<https://www.pinksale.finance/>  )
- TokenFi (<https://tokenfi.com/> )

#### 2.1.1 PinkSale

PinkSale allows you to create a token and manage your token all in one platform, which provides convenience to token issuers.

##### Step 1: Login with your wallet

1) **Connect your Wallet** 

   Enter <https://www.pinksale.finance/token/create> , choose “MetaMask” or “Trust Wallet”, use the wallet you just created in chapter 1.1 setup wallet

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.001.png)

##### Step 2: Create Token

1) **Select Create Token**

   Click Create token on the left navigation bar, you should be able to see the landing page as follow

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.002.png)

2) **Enter Token information** 

Here is how to set each parameter: 

**Chain**: It means the blockchain infrastructure where your token will be created and running all the time. Here we suggest you choose **BNB Chain.**

**Type**: It means token design mechanism, which contains several parameters, are typically employed to establish the mechanism by which the investors of the token will obtain the financial reward.Here we suggest you choose **Standard.**

**Name:** This is ideally a human readable name such as "ACE Coffee Coin".

**Symbol**: The token symbol is comparable to its ticker symbol, typically four or more characters are used such as "ACE".

**Total supply**: The amount of tokens that get minted at token creation. Usually you will not increase the supply after token creation, so it will be the total supply of your token at all times. The supply is usually determined by the desired token denomination (i.e. the nominal value per token). 

For example, for a bond offering with a nominal amount of USD 10 million and a denomination of USD 100,000 the supply would have to be 100 tokens.

**Decimals**: Values can be 0-18, when 0 is used, the token is not divisible. We suggest you set it as “**18**”.

3) **Confirm Transaction** 

Click the create token button then your wallet will be invoked. Confirm with your wallet, please notice you need to pay service fee using BNB, you should follow chapter 1.2 buy crypto to charge your wallet account  in advance.

##### Step 3: Check Your Token

You can see your token address and other basic information as follow 

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.004.png)

#### 2.1.2 TokenFi

##### Step 1: Login with your wallet

Enter <https://tl.tokenfi.com/create-token> , choose “MetaMask” or “Trust Wallet”

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.005.png)

**1. Select Token Type**:

Click the ERC-20 token, you should be able to see the landing page as follow: 

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.006.png)

**2. Enter Token information** 

Enter token information recording to your demand 

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.007.png)

Here is how to set each parameter: 

**Type**: It means token standard, we suggest you choose **ERC-20**. ERC-20 is a token standard which is most commonly used in company tokenization scenario, you do not need to understand the standard to continue your process, nevertheless, if you want to know more about the token standard, you can visit <https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/> for more information. 

**Logo**: The image icon of your token, it will show up on all your token promotion pages, we suggest you use images that are highly related to your company’s business so that investors can get more information from your logo image. You should prepare the image beforehand, and make sure that you have the copyright of your image. 

**Name:** This is ideally a human readable name such as "ACE Coffee Coin".

**Symbol**: The token symbol is comparable to its ticker symbol, typically four or more characters are used such as "ACE".

**Initial supply**: The amount of tokens that get minted at token creation. It should be no bigger than Max Supply. 

**Max Supply**: The sum up amount of tokens that you will mint all time.  We suggest you do not increase the supply after token creation, so the max supply will be set as the same as the initial supply. 

The supply is usually determined by the desired token denomination (i.e. the nominal value per token). 

For example, for a bond offering with a nominal amount of USD 10 million and a denomination of USD 100,000 the supply would have to be 100 tokens.

**Decimals**: Values can be 0-18, when 0 is used, the token is not divisible.We suggest you set it as **18**. 

**Treasury Wallet:** where the token will be sent to after the tokens are created. It is default set as the wallet address you used to login. Which means all the created tokens will be sent to your current wallet address. 

**Features and tokenomics:** This part is optional advanced features**,** which contains several parameters, are typically employed to establish the mechanism by which the investors of the token will obtain the financial reward.Here we suggest you **skip** this part. If you want to know more about this part, you can visit <https://docs.tokenfi.com/> for more guidance. 


**3. Confirm Transaction** 

Click the create token button then your wallet will be invoked. Confirm with your wallet, please notice you need to pay service fee using BNB, you should follow chapter 1.2 buy crypto to charge your wallet account  in advance.

##### Step 3: Check Your Token

You can see your token address and other basic information as follow 

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 21.008.png)

### 2.2 Presale

Now that your token has been created, you can invite your early investors to join your presale activities. Investors can buy your token through the presale link you created, you can quickly raise early-stage funding through pre-sales to develop your business.

It’s suggested that you use the same service providers to manage your presale. Here we suggest two service providers:

- PinkSale (<https://www.pinksale.finance/>  )
- TokenFi (<https://tokenfi.com/> )

#### 2.2.1 PinkSale

##### Step 1: Login with your wallet

Visit <https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/create/presale> and choose “MetaMask” or “Trust Wallet” to login.

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 221.001.png)

##### Step 2: Create Presale 

1) After login, choose launchpad>create presale in left navigation bar. 

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 221.002.png)

Here are the parameters you need to input:

**Address**:  Input your token address,if you created your token using PinkSale, it should be filled in automatically. Or you can find it at your token creation page. 

**Currency**:The token you will receive for your presale. Here we suggest you choose **BNB**.

**Fee Option**: Pinksale will charge your some fees for presale, Here we suggest you to choose **5% BNB**, which means PinkSale will charge 5% of all your BNB sold as Presale service fees 

**Listing Option**:Usually, you need to create a secondary marketplace for your tokens, so that your investors who have bought your tokens during the presale phase can sell the token to others in the secondary market if they do not want to hold the tokens anymore. You will need to add liquidity to the secondary market so that your investors can trade. By adding liquidity, part of your token pair with BNB will be automatically locked so as to be used to add liquidity in the future. Auto listing means liquidity will be added automatically after Finalize, manual listing means you have to add liquidity manually. By selecting auto listing, your token will be listed at PinkSwap automatically.We suggest you choose **Manual listing** to keep it simple. If you want to choose auto listing, you can visit <https://docs.pinksale.finance/launchpads/create-a-launchpad> for more guidance.  

**Pool Type:** It means the type of this round of token sale. Here we suggest you to choose **presale**

**Affiliate**: It indicates that you want to promote your project together with some KOLs Pinksale suggested. We suggest you **disable the Affiliate** program option.If you want to know more about affiliate, you can visit <https://docs.pinksale.finance/important/affiliate-program> for more guidance.  

2) Review again and click on “Next”.

##### Step 3: Add Launchpad Info

After verifying your token, you need to input the Presale information that you want to raise.

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 221.003.png) 

Here are some following important parameters:

**Presale Rate**: This is similar to token price, it means how many of your tokens an investor can receive if he gives 1 BNB. You must use positive numbers.

**Whitelist:** Choose "Enable" if you have a whitelist of presale contributors. You can enable/disable the whitelist anytime.We suggest you **disable** the whitelist to keep it simple. If you want to know more about affiliate, you can visit <https://docs.pinksale.finance/launchpads/whitelist-tiers> for more guidance. 

**Soft cap:** Soft cap means the least amount of tokens you need to sell for this presale to launch successfully. SoftCap must be greater than or equal to 25% of the hard cap.

**Hard cap**: It means the amount of tokens for your presale. Once you sell the amount of tokens, your presale will automatically stop

**Refund types:** you can choose refund or burn from the dropdown list. Here we suggest you choose **Refund**

**Minimum buy BNB:** how many bnb one investor need to pay at least in order to participate

**Maximum buy BNB:**how many bnb can one investor buy at most

**Start Time**: the start time of your presale, you can select now or later. 

**End Time**: the end time of your presale. Please make sure the start time is before the end time.

**Vesting Contributor**: Vesting For Contributors is a feature on PinkSale that helps projects to ensure long term price stability by locking away the tokens of presale investors for a period of time. It prevents presale investors from selling all their tokens at once at listing time, which causes too much sell pressure and crashes the price. To make it simple, we suggest you **disable** it. 

##### Step 4: Add Additional Info

Now that you have almost setup all the information you need for your presale, we suggest you add some additional info about your project so that your investors can know more about your company, your business, and be more willing to participate in your presale.


![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 221.004.png)

There are some notes for this step:

- Logo URL and website are required fields, cannot be blank. You can’t complete this step without those.
- Logo URL must end with a supported image extension: png, jpg, jpeg or gif.

For example:[ ](https://www.pinkswap.finance/pinkswap.png)<https://www.pinkswap.finance/pinkswap.png>

##### Step 5: Confirm with your wallet

This is the final step. You can review all the information one last time before submitting, after you have made sure that everything is perfect, or you can go back to the previous step to make any changes. Click “Approve Spending Token” and "Confirm" on Metamask. After that, click "Submit".

![](./company-tokenization-tutorial/Company Tokenization Tutorial 221.005.png)

After clicking on “Submit”, MetaMask/TrustWallet will now ask you to confirm the deal. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for the presale service.  If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.

##### Step 6: Check Your Presale Status
