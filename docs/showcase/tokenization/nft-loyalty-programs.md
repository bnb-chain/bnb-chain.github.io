title: Showcase - NFT Loyalty Programs Tokenization Tutorial
---

NFT Loyalty Programs based on NFTs can replace traditional paper-based systems and physical membership cards by enhancing user experience and user loyalty.

It generally takes 3 steps to create your NFT loyalty program: 

1) Preparation  

   1. Setup Wallet  
   2. Buy Crypto  

2) Create NFT


3) Distribute NFT  


There are plenty of tools and service providers in the BNB Chain ecosystem that can help you with the tokenization journey, we carefully select some of the best in our tutorial to guide you through the Web3 way. You can create your token in a few minutes with no coding or any blockchain knowledge. 

## 1 Preparation

Go to [Account Preparation Tutorial](./account-preparation.md) to get prepared before starting your tokenization journey. 

## 2 Create NFT 

After all the preparation work, you are now ready to create your NFT. 


To create a token, you only need to configure a few basic parameters. 

We suggest these two service providers since they provide one-stop service with rich features:

- NFTs2Me (<https://nfts2me.com/>  )
- Bitbond (<https://tokentool.Bitbond.com/> )


### 2.1 NFTs2Me


1) **Connect your Wallet** 

Open NFTs2Me and select the “Connect Wallet” option.
Choose your wallet (e.g.,Turstwallet/MetaMask). The system will ask you to sign a message to verify account ownership.

2) **Choose BNB Chain**

Once your wallet is connected, select the BNB Chain as the network to work on.
Make sure your wallet is on the same network to avoid errors.

4) **Upload Media and Complete the form** 

Business owners then can create an NFT, and decide the name, and media of the NFT.
Customers can mint the NFT for free to receive a brand-new virtual VIP card in the form of a unique NFT, which they can use to access membership benefits.

Enter the name of the collection (e.g., “ACE Milk Tea VIP Card”), a unique symbol to identify it and enter the descripcion.

Upload an image or multimedia file to represent the NFT, whether it's an image, GIF, or even a short video.

Select the initial phase to be Presale so that only customers on the Whitelist can claim their NFT. In addition, you have the option to:
Open the collection to everyone with the Public phase, allowing anyone who knows about the NFT to claim it. 
Set different prices for WhiteList users and the general public, rewarding early or loyal supporters with discounts.


Click “Deploy to BNB Smart Chain” to deploy the collection to the blockchain, then confirm the transaction in your wallet when prompted.

4) **Sign with your wallet** 

This confirmation will create a smart contract on BNB Chain containing the entire collection.

Once the process is complete, a modal window will display all the information about the NFT project, including a link to the minting page and a link to the dashboard for managing the project. In the next step, we will use this dashboard to manage the customer whitelist.
