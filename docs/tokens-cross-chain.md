# Cross-chain Token Management

The dual-chain architecture of BNB Beacon Chain & BNB Smart Chain empowers you to build your own decentralized apps. The native cross-chain communication mechanism allows tokens to be transferred between BC and BSC easily.

BNB Smart Chain and BNB Beacon Chain work together to ensure that one token can circulate in both formats with confirmed total supply and be used in different use cases.
