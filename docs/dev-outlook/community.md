# Buidling For the Community, With the Community, and By the Community

BNB has been on a journey. BSC is not the end, but another start. BSC is a testimony on how a great ecosystem can be co-built by the community. The same as other blockchain projects, the secret sauce of the success always includes the attitude to be more open, inclusive, collaborative, persistent and down-to-earth.

The research and development of the BNB ecosystem, with BSC as the first major inception point, will go further down the road to embrace the community, open source, and collective intelligence, which are essentially the good part of decentralization.

That is why we put this as a topic to push hard on persistently, for now and for the future.
