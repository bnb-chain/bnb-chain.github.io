# BNB Chain Cross-Chain Bridge Guide

> **Status:** Draft ¬∑ Last updated: 4 Jun 2025
---

## 1  Who Is This Guide For?

* üßë‚Äçüíª **Users** who want to transfer tokens in and out of BNB Chain from other chains like **Ethereum** or **Solana**.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Developers** who want to integrate a cross-chain bridge widget on their website using BNB Chain's **Canonical Bridge**.

## 2  Why This Guide Matters

Many users don‚Äôt realize that cross-chain transfers are possible or easy. BNB Chain offers a bridge aggregator that shows the **best route** for moving assets between chains using one of our **six route providers**:

**Supported Route Providers**:

* Stargate
* Celer
* deBridge
* Meson
* LayerZero
* Mayan

> ‚úÖ We help users **see available routes** for transferring assets **into or out of BNB Chain**, but we **do not operate the routes or control token availability**.

## 3  How to Use the BNB Chain Bridge (User Guide)

### Step-by-Step

1. Visit [bnbchain.org/en/bnb-chain-bridge](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-chain-bridge).
2. Choose your **source chain** (e.g. Ethereum) and **destination chain** (e.g. BNB Chain).
3. Connect your wallet to source chain.
4. Choose a token to bridge and enter the amount.
5. The bridge tool will display **available routes** based on your token and chains.
6. Click **Send** (or **Approve** if required).
7. Wait for the transaction to complete. You‚Äôll receive your tokens on the destination chain.

## 4  Understanding Bridge Aggregation

BNB Chain‚Äôs bridge tool is an **aggregator**. It finds available routes from partner bridge providers but:

* ‚ùå We do not custody tokens.
* ‚ùå We cannot add tokens ourselves.
* ‚úÖ We simplify access and offer visibility into supported routes.

You can use the bridge for **all directions** ‚Äì not just from BNB Chain to others, but also from Ethereum, Solana, and other supported chains **to BNB Chain**.

## 5  Developer Guide: Integrate the Canonical Bridge Widget
