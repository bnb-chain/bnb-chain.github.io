# BSC Governance Temperature Check


## Overview

BNB Chain governance involves a two-step process: temperature check and final decision voting. The temperature check, typically conducted through the Snapshot platform, allows any BNB holder to gauge community sentiment on a proposal. If the proposal receives enough support, it proceeds to the final decision voting phase. This phase often involves on-chain voting by validators or those with staked BNB, and the outcome determines whether the proposal is implemented or rejected.

## Submit a Proposal
