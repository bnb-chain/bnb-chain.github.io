# BSC Governance Temperature Check


## Overview

BNB Chain governance involves a two-step process: temperature check and final decision voting. The temperature check, typically conducted through the Snapshot platform, allows any BNB holder to gauge community sentiment on a proposal. If the proposal receives enough support, it proceeds to the final decision voting phase. This phase often involves on-chain voting by validators or those with staked BNB, and the outcome determines whether the proposal is implemented or rejected.

## Temperature Checking Voting Process

Step 1: Log in to voting space
URL: https://snapshot.org/#/bnbchain-dao.eth

Step 2: Go to the snapshot link of the proposal. For example, in this case, a community member created a voting proposal for BEP-341.

Step 3: Connect your wallet and vote

After you connect your wallet, make sure to use the same address of your BNB Staking. And choose the voting option.
