# Run BSC Validator

## Validator Hardware Requirements

### Mainnet

- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
- **IMPORTANT** 3T GB of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 500 MB/S throughput, read latency <1ms (if start with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD).
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 gigabytes of memory (RAM).
- Suggest m5zn.3xlarge or r7iz.4xlarge instance type on AWS, or c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 megabyte per second

### Testnet

- CPU: 4core, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8175M CPU @ 2.50GHz
- Memory: 16 GB
- Disk: ~1.5 TB
- Network Bandwidth: Upto 25 Gbps
- EBS Bandwidth: Upto 9.5 Gbps

## Setup Validator Node

### 1. Install BSC Fullnode

Follow the instructions [here to set up a full node](../developers/node_operators/full_node.md).

### 2. Prepare Accounts

Two accounts require preparation before running a validator: the Consensus account and the BLS Vote account.
Ensure these accounts match the corresponding ones when creating a new validator.

#### Generate Consensus Address
To create a new mining consensus account, run this command and set a password for the account:

```shell
geth account new --datadir ${DATA_DIR}
```

-  `DATA_DIR`: Where your key store files are saved.

If you already have a consensus account, skip this step. Save the password in a file named password.txt:

```shell
echo {your-password for the consensus account} > password.txt
```

#### Generate BLS Vote Address

To set up a new BLS account, use this command:

```shell
geth bls account new --datadir ${DATA_DIR}
```

-  `DATA_DIR`: The directory to store your key store files.

If you already have a BLS vote key, you can create a BLS wallet and recover it with the keyfile using:

```shell
geth bls account import ${KEY_FILE} --datadir ${DATA_DIR}
```

To retrieve your bls address, run:

```shell
geth bls account list --datadir ${DATA_DIR}
```

Save the password in a file named blspassword.txt:

```shell
echo {your-password for the BLS wallet} > blspassword.txt
```

### 3. Start Validator Node

> Warning: Please do not expose your RPC endpoints to public network!

Start your validator using the command line below:

```bash
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node --syncmode snap -unlock {accounts to sign txs, including your mining account at least} --miner.etherbase {the address of your mining account} --password password.txt --blspassword blspassword.txt --mine --vote --allow-insecure-unlock --cache 18000
```

## Post Running

### 1. Monitor node status

To get started quickly, run GethExporter in a Docker container.

```
docker run -it -d -p 9090:9090 \
  -e "GETH=http://mygethserverhere.com:8545" \
  hunterlong/gethexporter
```

### 2. Update validator profile

You can submit a PullRequest to this repository to update your information: <https://github.com/bnb-chain/validator-directory>

Reference: <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6976>


### 3. Publish Validator Information

Please submit a Pull Request to this repo <https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-validator-directory>

This repository is a place for validator candidates to give potential delegators a brief introduction about your team and infrastructure, and present your ecosystem contributions.

### 4. Stop Validating

You can stop mining new blocks by sending commands in **geth console**

Connect to your validator node with **geth attach ipc:path/to/geth.ipc**

```bash
miner.stop()
```

To resume validating,
```bash
miner.start()
```
