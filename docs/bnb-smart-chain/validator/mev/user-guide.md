# User Guide

PBS(Proposer-Builder Separation) framework offers several advantages for BNB Chain users:

- Users are less likely to have their transactions front-run or sandwiched. 
- Increased competition among block builders can lead to more efficient markets and potentially lower gas prices. 
- Enhanced transaction privacy: Users' transactions are exposed to fewer parties before being included in a block. 
- Faster transaction processing: More efficient block construction can lead to quicker transaction confirmations.
