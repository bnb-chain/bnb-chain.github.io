title: Quick Guide - BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
---

If you are a developer looking to build applications on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), this document provides all the essential information you need.

## Getting Started

BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a high-performance blockchain network.

Since BSC is EVM-compatible, your existing Ethereum smart contract skills will seamlessly transfer to BSC.

## Connecting

Here are some resources to help you get connected to the BSC network:

- [Network Information and RPC Providers](./rpc.md)
- [Wallet Configuration](./wallet-configuration.md)

## Get Tokens

BNB is the native utility token of BNB Smart Chain and is used to pay transaction fees. For the testnet, you can use the faucet to obtain test tokens on BSC.

- [BSC Testnet Faucet](./faucet.md)

For the mainnet, you can withdraw tokens directly from a centralized exchange (CEX) which supports BSC network(e.g. Binance).

## JSON-RPC API

Interacting with BSC requires sending requests to specific JSON-RPC API methods. BSC's APIs are compatible with Geth.

## Developer Tools
- Explorer
    - [NodeReal BSC Scan](https://bsctrace.com/)
    - [BSCScan](https://bscscan.com/)
- SDK. If you are only using the SDK for Ethereum-compatible functions, then all Ethereum SDKs should work with BSC.
