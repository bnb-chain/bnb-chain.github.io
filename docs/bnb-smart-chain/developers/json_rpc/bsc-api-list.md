## Finality API
Finality is a crucial aspect of blockchain security, ensuring that once a block is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or altered. This provides users with the confidence to act on the information in the block without delay.

### Probabilistic Finality and Economic Finality

BNB Smart Chain (BSC) implements a dual-layer finality mechanism combining Economic Finality and Probabilistic Finality to ensure transaction security and network efficiency.

#### Economic Finality (Fast Finality)

The Fast Finality feature, introduced through **[BEP-126](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP126.md)**, enables Economic Finality using a slashing mechanism similar to Casper FFG and Tendermint. Key characteristics:

- Block n achieves economic finality by block n+2
- Transaction finality time: **~3.75 seconds** (with 1.5 seconds block time)
- Economic penalties make block reversal extremely expensive
- Validators violating voting rules forfeit part of their staked assets

This significantly improves user experience through faster and more reliable transaction confirmations.

#### Probabilistic Finality (Fallback Mechanism)

When Fast Finality is unavailable, BSC falls back to Probabilistic Finality. Security increases as more blocks are added - the deeper a block is buried, the lower the probability of reversal.

Network Parameters:

- TurnLength: 8 (consecutive blocks per validator)
- ValidatorSize: 21 (total active validators)
- Block Time: ~1.5 seconds

Finality Requirements:

- Majority (>1/2) validator confirmations: 88 blocks (11 × 8) ≈ 132 seconds
- Supermajority (>2/3) validator confirmations: 120 blocks (15 × 8) ≈ 180 seconds

This dual-layer approach ensures network security and finality guarantees even when Fast Finality encounters issues.

### Economic Finality API

### [eth_getHeaderByNumber](<https://www.quicknode.com/docs/kaia/eth_getHeaderByNumber>) as in the Ethereum client.
**Parameters**

**BlockNumber** QUANTITY|TAG

* HEX String - an integer block number
* String "earliest" for the earliest/genesis block
* String "latest" - for the latest mined block
* String "safe" - for the latest justified head block
* String "**finalized**" - for the latest finalized block

### [eth_getBlockByNumber](<https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbynumber>) as in the Ethereum client.
**Parameters**

**BlockNumber** QUANTITY|TAG

* HEX String - an integer block number
* String "earliest" for the earliest/genesis block
* String "latest" - for the latest mined block
* String "safe" - for the latest justified head block
* String "**finalized**" - for the latest finalized block
  
**Full_transaction_flag** Boolean

- If true it returns the full transaction objects, if false only the hashes of the transactions.

### eth_newFinalizedHeaderFilter
Here are two APIs that can help you trace the latest finalized blocks:
1. Create a finalized header filter:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8545" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_newFinalizedHeaderFilter","params":[],"id":1}'
```
This will return an rpc.ID which will expire in 5 minutes, then you can get another:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xcbdc7c21459e2cfbf72e2028f15a98c"}
```
2. Get latest finalized blocks using above rpc.ID. You can call it many times until rpc.ID expires:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8545" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getFilterChanges","params":["0xcbdc7c21459e2cfbf72e2028f15a98c"],"id":1}'
```
This will return block hashes:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":["0x4b52061726b9f15905217699fd5dab8ff9bb704b3b16d27c34541cb15752a91f","0x2b984b80b25f0dddc92ba11290a3d250fc8a3ec6a09bd485c21dbbb8155d2f90"]}
```

### Combined Probabilistic Finality and Economic Finality API

These methods allow you to handle block finality using a straightforward API.

### eth_getFinalizedHeader
* `verifiedValidatorNum` must be within the range `[1, len(currentValidators)]`,with the exception that:
    - `-1` represents at least `len(currentValidators) * 1/2`
    - `-2` represents at least `len(currentValidators) * 2/3`
    - `-3` represents at least `len(currentValidators)`
* This function calculates `probabilisticFinalizedHeight` as the highest height of the block verified by `verifiedValidatorNum` validators and then returns the block header with a height equal to `max(fastFinalizedHeight, probabilisticFinalizedHeight)`.
* The height of the returned block header is guaranteed to increase monotonically.
For example:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8545/" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getFinalizedHeader","params":[15],"id":1}'
```

### eth_getFinalizedBlock
* `verifiedValidatorNum` must be within the range `[1, len(currentValidators)]`,with the exception that:
    - `-1` represents at least `len(currentValidators) * 1/2`
    - `-2` represents at least `len(currentValidators) * 2/3`
    - `-3` represents at least `len(currentValidators)`
* This function calculates `probabilisticFinalizedHeight` as the highest height of the block verified by `verifiedValidatorNum` validators and then returns the block header with a height equal to `max(fastFinalizedHeight, probabilisticFinalizedHeight)`.
* If `fullTx` is true, the block includes all transactions; otherwise, only transaction hashes are included.
* The height of the returned block is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
For example:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8545/" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getFinalizedBlock","params":[11, false],"id":1}'

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8545/" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getFinalizedBlock","params":[15, true],"id":1}'
