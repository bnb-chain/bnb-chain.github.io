# How to Run an Archive Node on BNB Smart Chain

## What is an archive node?

Simply speaking, an archive node is a full node running with an additional special option, `--gcmode archive`. It stores all the historical data of the blockchain starting from the genesis block. As compared to a typical full node that just holds all the state change data for some latest blocks, an archive node always stores them for each block.

## Why is an archive node important?

Developers are limited to querying the limited recent blocks to check the balance of an address and the state of a smart contract with a full node. It is hard to get all what they want as the blockchain is moving forward at the same time, while they can query any block at a specific point in time with an archive node.
Archive nodes are used by various applications on the blockchain for challenging use cases, including but not limited to the followings:

- Automatic trading system needs historical data to optimize trading model
- Verification modules need state data to verify transactions in time
- Analytical tools need full historical data to do data analysis
- Exchange in some wallets depends on archive node for fast and efficient transfers

## Suggested Requirements

Running an archive node will take a high cost as it includes all the block and state change data. First of all it needs the disk with sufficient capacity; besides this, the CPU and disk performance should be good enough to catch up with the latest block height. You can refer to the [suggested hardware requirements](https://github.com/node-real/bsc-erigon?tab=readme-ov-file#system-requirements).

## How to run an archive node for BSC mainnet?

### Run with an Erigon client

[Erigon](https://github.com/node-real/bsc-erigon) now supports the BSC mainnet. The latest version allows you to sync an archive node from scratch in just 3 days, using 4.3 TB of disk space. You can use Erigon to operate an archive node as shown below.


### Run with a Reth client

[Reth](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth) now supports the BSC network and demonstrates superior performance compared to Geth and Erigon in recent benchmark tests. You can utilize reth to operate an archive node (as well as full node); for more information, refer to [Full Node](./full_node.md).

### BSC Erigon Node Deployment

BSC Erigon, maintained by the Node Real team, is a fork of Erigon aimed at becoming the premier archive node implementation for the BSC network.

## Hardware Requirements

To ensure optimal performance of your BSC Erigon node, we recommend the following hardware specifications:

* RAM: 64GB or more (higher RAM correlates with better performance)
* Storage: SSD or NVMe
    - Archive Node: Minimum 5TB
    - Fast Node: Minimum 700GB

## BSC Erigon Node Deployment Steps

### 1. Obtain the Erigon Binary

Option 1: Build from source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/node-real/bsc-erigon.git
cd bsc-erigon
make erigon
```
Option 2: Use Docker image
```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/node-real/bsc-erigon:${latest_version}
```
### 2. Launch the Erigon Node
By default, the node will run in archive mode. Syncing from scratch typically takes about 3 days.
```shell
./build/bin/erigon \
--datadir="<your_data_directory_path>" \
--chain=bsc \
--port=30303 \
--http.port=8545 \
--authrpc.port=8551 \
--torrent.port=42069 \
--private.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9090 \
--http --ws \
--http.api=eth,debug,net,trace,web3,erigon,bsc
```
**Note**: To avoid port conflicts, specify different ports for each chain if running multiple instances.

### 3. Running a Fast Node (Non-Archive Mode)
   Add the --prune.mode=minimal flag to start a fast node. This mode retains only the last 3 days of state and block data, supporting debug_trace* operations for the past 3 days.

If you prefer not to spend days syncing, you can obtain fast node snapshots from [community-maintained repositories](https://github.com/48Club/bsc-snapshots).

By following these steps, you can flexibly deploy either a full BSC Erigon node or a fast node based on your requirements. Whichever option you choose, BSC Erigon will provide you with an efficient and reliable node service.
