title: Migrating NEXO from Tangem Wallet - BSC FAQs
---

### Why can’t I migrate or withdraw my NEXO tokens from Tangem Wallet?

If you held NEXO tokens on the Beacon Chain and missed the migration window last summer or fall, you might find that your NEXO tokens are stuck in your Tangem Wallet. Currently, the Tangem Wallet only provides options for **Trust Wallet** and **BNB Chain** migration, but doesn't support **WalletConnect**, which is typically needed to complete the migration process.

### What’s the workaround if I can’t complete migration via Tangem Wallet?

You can export your wallet’s **mnemonic phrase** from Tangem and then import it into **Trust Wallet**, which supports WalletConnect and gives you access to your NEXO tokens on the BNB Smart Chain.

### How do I export my mnemonic phrase from Tangem?

1. Open the **Tangem Wallet app**.
2. Go to **Wallet Settings**.
3. Find and select **Export Mnemonic** or **Backup Phrase**.
4. Save the 12 or 24-word phrase securely and **never share it** with anyone.

### How do I import my mnemonic into Trust Wallet?

1. Download and open **Trust Wallet**.
2. Choose **Import Wallet** > **Multi-Coin Wallet**.
3. Enter your mnemonic phrase.
4. Once imported, you will have access to your wallet via Trust Wallet.

### How do I access and migrate my NEXO tokens on BSC using Trust Wallet?

1. Enable the **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)** in Trust Wallet.
2. Add the **NEXO token manually** if it does not appear automatically.
3. Use **WalletConnect** to access the migration dApp or platform that supports Beacon Chain to BSC migration.
4. Follow the dApp's instructions to complete the migration.

### Is there a specific contract address I need to use for NEXO on BSC?

Yes. Make sure to use the **correct and official contract address** for NEXO on BNB Smart Chain to ensure your tokens are recognized and not lost.

> **Tip:** You can find the official contract address on trusted sources such as [BNB Smart Chain explorers](https://bscscan.com/).

### What if I don’t feel comfortable handling mnemonic phrases?

If you're unsure or uncomfortable with this process, it's strongly advised to contact **Tangem support** or a qualified crypto advisor. Never share your recovery phrase publicly or with untrusted sources.

### Is this issue specific to BSC?

Yes, this FAQ addresses issues specifically related to NEXO migration to **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)**.
