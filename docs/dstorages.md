# Decentralized Storage
Decentralized storage system enable users to store their data in a peer-to-peer distributed network which consists of operators across different locations. Comparing with centralized storage, it offers more control, privacy as well as security over the user's own data. Further more, decentralized storage is more resilient since there is no single point of failure of the storage.

Following is the list of decentralized Storage protocols or networks that you can used with BNB Chain.

- [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.tech/): The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file system allows users to store and access verifiable and content-addressable data in a peer-to-peer network.. It is a distributed protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient and more open.
- [**Filecoin**](https://filecoin.io/build/): Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time. Filecoin combines the benefits of storage on [IPFS](https://docs.filecoin.io/developers/introduction/overview/#) with blockchain-powered verifiability and persistency. The network offers robust and resilient distributed storage at massively lower cost compared to current centralized alternatives.
- [**SpheronNetwork**](https://spheron.network/): Deploy, manage & scale your applications utilising Web3 Infrastructure.
