!!! note
    One thing to note is if the value of the cross-chain transfer is over 1000BNB, the funds will be locked in `TokenHub` for 12 hours before they can be withdrawn.
    Usually, a third-party server will help withdraw the unlocked token to the recipient, and users can also withdraw to the recipient themselves by following [unlock document](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts#large-transfer-unlock)
