## Steps for Contributing on GitHub

- Make sure you have a GitHub account.
- Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Minor Changes
- Documentation
- For small changes to comments and documentation, it is not always necessary to create a new GitHub issue. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit with 'doc' instead of an issue number.

## Finding things to work on

The first place to start is always looking over the current GitHub issues for the project you are interested in contributing to. Issues marked with `help wanted` are usually pretty self-contained and a good place to get started.

Of course, feel free to create a new issue if you think something needs to be added or fixed.

## Making Changes

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually the master branch. Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
- Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes and make sure all tests pass.

## Submitting Changes

- Submit a pull request to the docs repository in the BNB Chain organization.
- Include a descriptive `commit message`.
- Changes contributed via pull request should focus on a single issue at a time.
- Rebase your local changes against the master branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise.
