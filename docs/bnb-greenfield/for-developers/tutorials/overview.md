# Overview: Building Decentralized Applications (dApps) with BNB Greenfield

In this section, we will introduce the two main methods for developing dApps on BNB Greenfield: using smart contracts deployed to BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and interacting directly with BNB Greenfield through our Software Development Kit (SDK) or Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Data Marketplace Demo
Data marketplace is a data exchange platform where users can freely create, list, trade,
and sell data assets, including digital publications, scientific experimental data, and specific domain data.

### Demo Link

- Testnet: `https://marketplace.greenfield-sp.bnbchain.org/bsc-testnet.html`

- Smart Contracts: `https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-data-marketplace-contracts`


## Developing with smart contracts on BSC
One of the primary methods for building dApps with BNB Greenfield is by deploying smart contracts to the BSC. Smart contracts are self-executing programs that facilitate and enforce the execution of agreements without the need for intermediaries.

In this section, we will guide you through the process of creating, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts on BSC using popular development frameworks like Solidity and Truffle. You can find detailed tutorials and examples for developing dApps using smart contracts in the [Building Smart Contract dApps](app/overview.md) section.

## Interacting with BNB Greenfield through SDK and CLI
BNB Greenfield offers two native application options for interacting with the platform without involving the development of smart contracts:

### Software Development Kit (SDK)
The Software Development Kit (SDK) is a powerful set of tools, libraries, and APIs that enable seamless integration with BNB Greenfield's decentralized storage system. The SDK allows you to build dApps using only the SDK functionalities, without the need to develop smart contracts. With the SDK, you can store and retrieve data, manage access controls, and handle encryption to ensure the privacy and security of your dApp's data.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
The Command Line Interface (CLI) is another native application provided by BNB Greenfield, allowing you to interact with the platform directly from the terminal. The CLI provides various commands to perform essential tasks efficiently, such as uploading files, managing data permissions, and monitoring storage usage. As with the SDK, using the CLI does not involve the development of smart contracts.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each native application, providing step-by-step guides, code snippets, and best practices to empower you to create powerful and innovative dApps without the need for smart contract development.
