title: EVM Programmability - BNB Greenfield Cross Chain

---

# EVM Programmability

This document give a detailed introduction of cross-chain primitives that have been defined on EVM-compatible chains to 
enable developers to manage greenfield resources on the EVM-compatible chains directly.

The [Greenfield-Contracts Repo](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts) is the underlying backbone of the
cross chain communication protocol. It is responsible for implementing the core cross-chain communication functionality that enables seamless interaction between Greenfield and EVM-compatible chains, like BSC and opBNB. 
The library handles the complexities of cross-chain operations, ensuring secure and efficient communication.

During the development process, developers are most likely to interact with the following contracts: `CrossChain`, `BucketHub`, `ObjectHub`, `GroupHub`, `PermissionHub`, `MultiMessage` and `GreenfieldExecutor`.

Refer to the [contract list](./contract-list.md) for detailed contract address on different network.


## CallBack Handling
dApps on EVM-compatible chains, i.e. smart contracts on BSC, are allowed to implement their own logic to handle ACK and FAIL_ACK packages.
The smart contracts can register callback functions to handle the ACK packages.
To avoid consuming too much gas in callbacks, a gas limitation estimation should be done by the smart contracts that register
the callbacks.

Errors and failures can occur during cross-chain communication. dApps on EVM-compatible chains can handle these by retrying the package with
a higher gas limit, skipping the package to tolerate failure, or upgrading their contract to handle corner cases.

The following are the interfaces for dapps to handle failures:

```solidity
 // retry the first failed package in the queue
 function retryPackage() external;
 // skip the first failed package in the queue
 function skipPackage() external;
```

## Permission Programmability 
Whether resources are created on BSC or mapped from Greenfield to BSC, such as Buckets, Objects, and Groups, by default, 
only the owner account of these resources can manage them. However, with proper authorization, 
other accounts or contracts can be allowed to operate on the owner's resources. 
We provide two methods of authorization:

### Role-based authorization
BucketHub, ObjectHub, and GroupHub all implement the following interface. Through the `grant` interface, 
other accounts can be granted the permission to create, delete, and update this type of resource for a certain period. 
This permission can also be revoked through the `revoke` interface.
```solidity
function grant(address account, uint32 acCode, uint256 expireTime) external {
 ...
}
function revoke(address account, uint32 acCode) external {
    ...
}
```
### NFT token authorization
Since BucketHub and ObjectHub implement the NFT721 standard, and GroupHub implements the ERC1155 standard, 
we use `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` to authorize specific resource Token IDs without restricting the types of operations, 
meaning both deletion and updating are allowed.

```solidity
function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual {
    ...
}
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public virtual {
    ...
}
```

## Detailed Interface
They provide the following interfaces respectively:

**IGroupHub**

The `GroupHub` contract provides the following interfaces to manage Group on BSC/opBNB directly.

   ```solidity
   interface IGroupHub {
       /** 
        * @dev  Query the contract address of group NFT.
        * @return The contract address of group token.
        * Each group will be mapped as a NFT on BSC.
        * Group ID and NFT token ID are the same.
        */
       function ERC721Token() external view returns (address);
       /**

        * The member inside a group  will be mapped as a ERC1155 token on BSC.
        * The ID of the ERC1155 token is same with the group ID.
