title: Contract as Bucket Owner - BNB Greenfield Demo

#  Greenfield Demo: Contract as Bucket Owner
BNB Greenfield provides the ability for a contract to manage buckets through greenfield cross-chain transactions, 
and we'll use a demo to briefly demonstrate the process.

## Source Code
- Greenfield Demo App Contract: [GreenfieldDemo](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts/blob/develop/contracts/example/GreenfieldDemo.sol)
- Script to Interact with Demo: [Demo Script](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts/blob/develop/scripts/11-demo-contract-approve-eoa-upload.ts) 

## Greenfield Demo Contract
The Demo includes the following parts:
### greenfield contracts constant:
```solidity
    // BSC testnet
    address public constant TOKEN_HUB = 0xED8e5C546F84442219A5a987EE1D820698528E04;
    address public constant CROSS_CHAIN = 0xa5B2c9194131A4E0BFaCbF9E5D6722c873159cb7;
    address public constant BUCKET_HUB = 0x5BB17A87D03620b313C39C24029C94cB5714814A;
    address public constant PERMISSION_HUB = 0x25E1eeDb5CaBf288210B132321FBB2d90b4174ad;
    address public constant SP_ADDRESS_TESTNET = 0x5FFf5A6c94b182fB965B40C7B9F30199b969eD2f;
    address public constant GREENFIELD_EXECUTOR = 0x3E3180883308e8B4946C9a485F8d91F8b15dC48e;
```
The addresses of Greenfield contracts deployed on the BSC testnet are available and configured here. You can find contracts deployed on other networks [contract entrypoint](https://docs.bnbchain.org/bnb-greenfield/for-developers/cross-chain-integration/contract-list)

### create bucket and set bucket flow rate limit
```solidity
    function createBucket(string memory bucketName, uint256 transferOutAmount, bytes memory _executorData) external payable;
```
Provides the bucket name, initial BNB amount transferred to the demo contract on Greenfield and the executor data
to set bucket flow rate limit.This API will create a new bucket owned by the smart contract and set the payment for it.

### create policy to allow eoa account to upload files to the bucket
```solidity
    function createPolicy(bytes memory createPolicyData) external payable;
```
Construct the `createPolicyData` parameters to grant permission to the dedicated principle for the created bucket owned by the smart contract.

## Interact Script
### Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts.git
cd greenfield-contracts && git checkout develop
npm install
npx hardhat compile

cp .env.example .env
# set `DeployerPrivateKey` on .env
# make sure the tBNB balance of the account >= 0.5 BNB on BSC Testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/11-demo-contract-approve-eoa-upload.ts  --network bsc-testnet
```

### Workflow

The interact script includes 4 steps as follows: 
#### deploy demo contract
```typescript
    const demo = (await deployContract(operator, 'GreenfieldDemo')) as GreenfieldDemo;
```

#### create bucket whose owner is the demo contract 
set bucket flow rate limit and cross-chain transfer 0.1 BNB to demo contract
```typescript
const bucketName = 'test-' + demo.address.substring(2, 6).toLowerCase();
// - transferOutAmt: 0.1 BNB to demo contract on Greenfield
// - set bucket flow rate limit to this bucket
// - create bucket: 'test-approve-eoa-upload', its owner is demo contract
const dataSetBucketFlowRateLimit = ExecutorMsg.getSetBucketFlowRateLimitParams({
    bucketName,
    bucketOwner: demo.address,
    operator: demo.address,
    paymentAddress: demo.address,
    flowRateLimit: '1000000000000000000',
});
const executorData = dataSetBucketFlowRateLimit[1];
const transferOutAmt = ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1');
const value = transferOutAmt.add(relayFee.mul(3).add(ackRelayFee.mul(2)));

log('- transfer out to demo contract on greenfield', toHuman(transferOutAmt));
log('- create bucket', bucketName);
log('send crosschain tx!');
const receipt = await waitTx(
    demo.createBucket(bucketName, transferOutAmt, executorData, { value })
);
log(`https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}`);
```

#### get bucket id by name after bucket created
```typescript
const bucketInfo = await client.bucket.getBucketMeta({ bucketName });
const bucketId = bucketInfo.body!.GfSpGetBucketMetaResponse.Bucket.BucketInfo.Id;
log('bucket created, bucket id', bucketId);
const hexBucketId = `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000${BigInt(
    bucketId
).toString(16)}`;
log(`https://testnet.greenfieldscan.com/bucket/${hexBucketId}`);
```

#### create policy to allow EOA account upload files to the bucket through cross-chain transaction
```typescript
const uploaderEoaAccount = operator.address; // TODO set your eoa account to upload files
log('try to set uploader(eoa account) is', uploaderEoaAccount);

const policyDataToAllowUserOperateBucket = Policy.encode({
    id: '0',
    resourceId: bucketId, // bucket id
    resourceType: ResourceType.RESOURCE_TYPE_BUCKET,
    statements: [
        {
            effect: Effect.EFFECT_ALLOW,
            actions: [ActionType.ACTION_CREATE_OBJECT], // allow upload file to the bucket
            resources: [],
        },
    ],
    principal: {
        type: PrincipalType.PRINCIPAL_TYPE_GNFD_ACCOUNT,
        value: uploaderEoaAccount,
    },
}).finish();

await waitTx(
    demo.createPolicy(policyDataToAllowUserOperateBucket, { value: relayFee.add(ackRelayFee) })
);
```

Now the deployer account can upload files to the bucket on Greenfield.
