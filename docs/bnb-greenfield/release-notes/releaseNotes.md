refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.6.0) and [Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

## Greenfield v1.5.0 - Pawnee Upgrade
BNB Greenfield v1.5.0 introduces the Pawnee Hardfork, which includes the following major feature:

- Support Greenfield Atomic Object Update: Previously, users face the inconvenience of having to delete and recreate objects in Greenfield in order to replace their content. 
   v1.5.0 offer a more efficient and seamless object update process. See [https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP-366.md](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP-366.md)

Greenfield v1.5.0 also includes several optimization features and bug fixes. For more details about this release, please
refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.5.0) and [Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

## Greenfield v1.4.0 - Ural Upgrade
BNB Greenfield v1.4.0 introduces the Ural Hardfork, which includes the following features:

1. Support setting resource tags by accounts with permission: Previously, only the owner of a resource could set tags.
   However, in certain scenarios, users may desire other authorized accounts to be able to set tags on behalf of the owner.
2. Support bucket migration: In Greenfield, each bucket is associated with a primary SP. If a user is dissatisfied with
   the service from their current primary SP, they have the option to migrate their bucket to another SP.

Greenfield v1.4.0 also includes several optimization features and bug fixes. For more details about this release, please
refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.4.0) and [Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

## Greenfield v1.3.0 - Hulunbeier Upgrade
BNB Greenfield v1.3.0 introduces the Hulunbeier Hardfork, which includes the following features:

1. Cross-chain permission module: With this new feature, users can now grant permissions from the BSC/opBNB side. This
   enhancement provides greater programmability and flexibility. For more details, please refer to [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/pull/334).
2. Support the exit of SP: With this new feature, SPs on Greenfield can now exit without any restrictions. For more
   details, please refer to [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/pull/338).

Greenfield v1.3.0 also includes several optimization features and bug fixes. For more details about this release, please
refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.3.0) and [Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.3.0).

## Greenfield v1.2.0 - Manchurian Upgrade
BNB Greenfield v1.2.0 introduces the Manchurian Hardfork, which includes the following features:

1. Support setting tags for buckets, objects, and groups. We encourage the community to create an indexing service for tags to enhance
query capabilities. For additional information, please visit [here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/community-contributions/blob/main/bnb-greenfield-wishlist-corechain.md#challenge-greenfield-tagging-and-indexing-service).

2. Users can query object before the object is sealed. Currently, users have to wait for an object to be sealed before
they can download the object. However, sealing the object requires coordination among SPs. If some SPs are temporarily
unavailable, it can affect the sealing process and consequently impact user access. In this version, the Primary SP will
make every effort to ensure successful sealing of the file on the blockchain. Until then, users can access the object in
advance. It is important to note that there is still a small probability that the file may fail to seal, in which case
the SP will reject it and users will need to handle such exceptional situations.

Greenfield v1.2.0 also includes several optimization features and bug fixes. For more details about this release, please
refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and [Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

## Greenfield v1.1.0 - Pampas Upgrade
BNB Greenfield v1.1.0 introduces the Pampas Hardfork, which enables cross-chain resource interoperability between
Greenfield and opBNB. With this upgrade, developers can now control resources on Greenfield by writing applications on
opBNB. This cross-chain programmability is similar to the interoperability between BSC and Greenfield. However, compared
to BSC, opBNB offers cheaper gas fees and faster cross-chain finality. It's important to note that the cross-chain
access between Greenfield and opBNB is limited to storage resources (bucket, object, group) and does not support the
transfer of BNB tokens between these two chains.

To facilitate cross-chain accessibility between Greenfield and opBNB, validators need to upgrade their relayers running
between Greenfield and BSC to [Relayer v1.1.1](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-relayer/releases/tag/v1.1.1) before
the Pampas Hardfork. Additionally, they should deploy an additional relayer for Greenfield and opBNB, following the
instructions in the [Run Relayer](../greenfield-blockchain/run-node/run-relayer.md).

Furthermore, in version v1.1.0, we have temporarily disabled the SP Exit and Bucket Migration processes due to their
complexity and the difficulty in ensuring stability. We are working on optimizing these features and will introduce a
more efficient and robust solution in the next version.

Greenfield v1.1.0 also includes several optimization features and bug fixes. For more details about this release, please
refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and [Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## Greenfield v1.0.0 - Initial version for Mainnet
This is the official version released for Greenfield Mainnet, which includes most of the features that have been
thoroughly tested during the Testnet phase. You can refer to our [Feature Lists](./features.md).

Currently, we need to conduct more testing and make improvements on the Testnet for the complexity of SP Exit and
Bucket Migration. We plan to enable these two features on the Mainnet in the near future.

Please refer to [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and
[Greenfield SP](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for more details about the release.

## Greenfield v0.2.6 - Final release before mainnet
[v0.2.6](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v0.2.6) This is the final version before the mainnet launch, 
which mainly includes bug fixes and security enhancement.

- Change few events the blockchain and enhance the parameter verification.
- Refactor the code for getObject and Universal apis.
- Strength the authentication and verification processes between storage providers.
- Fix the vulnerability of not comparing the chain hash when uploading data.
- Fix few bugs, like panic, memory leakage on storage provider.
- Addressed several security vulnerabilities in the smart contract.

## Greenfield v0.2.5 - Testnet Nagqu Upgrade

BNB Greenfield is undergoing Nagqu upgrade for the testnet version to [v0.2.5](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v0.2.5). 
The Nagqu upgrade took place at block height 471350, estimated to be on Sep 15th at 
03:20 AM considering the current block generation rate.

*Please be aware that the upcoming hardfork will not impact your account balance on Greenfield. 
All buckets and objects stored on the Greenfield Testnet before will remain accessible.*

This version has undergone comprehensive security enhancements as the final hardfork version prior to the mainnet launch. This mainly includes:

- The Greenfield resource mirror smart contracts apply more stringent parameter checks.
- Preventing funds in payment accounts from being permanently trapped in the Cosmos Bank module through intelligent detection.
- Introducing timer-lock mechanism: funds exceeding 100 BNB will be subject to a one-day lock-up period upon withdrawal from the payment account.
- Enhance authentication logic between storage providers.


To enhance the user experience, the developer community is introducing new features and improvements.

- Introduce the official native SDK for Ali Oss-based SP to enhance stability.
- Improve the performance and stability of SP processing for file uploads. The standard specifications of SP allow for the stable processing of 10 files per second with a size of 1M.
- Optimize user read traffic billing based on actual usage rather than download count.
- Command line optimization, like support folder upload.


For other detailed features, bug fixes, and refactoring, please refer to the changelog in [Greenfield Blockchain](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Greenfield v0.2.1 - Mekong Testnet reset.

On May 25th, we reset the Greenfield Testnet and upgrade the Greenfield version to v0.2.1. We're excited to introduce this as the Mekong Testnet. Here are key changes to note.

🔸The Greenfield BSC Testnet (Chain ID: 5601) will be discontinued. Instead, we'll deploy the Greenfield Cross-Chain contracts on the BSC Chapel Testnet (Chain ID: 97).  This means you can fully utilize all the infrastructure of the current BSC Chapel Testnet, such as bscscan, tenderly, theGraph, and so on. BNB and Greenfield resources can still flow freely between Greenfield testnet and BSC testnet.

🔸The Greenfield Blockchain gRPC Endpoint will no longer be provided. The ETH-API endpoint has now been integrated with the Tendermint endpoint. All you need is the Tendermint endpoint for the Greenfield Blockchain. Please use [Chainlist](https://www.bnbchainlist.org/) to quickly add BSC Testnet and Greenfield Mekong Testnet.

🔸All buckets/objects previously stored on Greenfield Testnet will be cleared and won't be available for query anymore. Friendly reminder: Please do not save important data on the testnet. The team will periodically delete outdated data.

🔸All account balances will also be reset. However, accounts with a balance under 10 tBNBs can look forward to an airdrop after the reset. For new users, Greenfield will not provide redundant faucets any longer, please get the test BNB from the official faucet [discord channel](https://discord.gg/bnbchain) and use [Dcellar](https://dcellar.io/) to convert it to the BNB on Greenfield.

🔸As this is a breaking upgrade, the team will update the document as soon as possible the maintenance is done.

Greenfield v0.2.1 - Release for Mekong Testnet 🎉

The [Greenfield Blockchain v0.2.1](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and [Storage Provider v0.2.1](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v0.2.1) introduces several enhancement exciting features. Let's take a look at these:

### Enhancement and Feature List 📝
- Bump cosmos-sdk core to version v0.47.2. Cosmos-sdk v0.47.x and v0.46.x have significant differences in consensus engine, ABCI, encoding, dependency injection, and other aspects. Greenfield hopes to update to this version this morning to avoid future upgrade difficulties.
- [Challenge Verifier](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/docs/guide/introduction/ecosystem.html#challenge-verifier) is introduced in  Mekong Testnet. By using Challenge Verifier, the network can ensure that only reliable and trustworthy storage providers are allowed to participate, protecting the network from any potential data loss, corruption, or low-quality service.
- Discontinue object and stale permission GC is introduced in v0.2.1. These two features allow for a lighter blockchain state and allow SPs on the testnet to periodically clean up data to maintain long-term operation even without incentives.
- Support for more diverse methods of file searches, such as listing objects by prefix or by folder.
- Implemented a garbage collection module for the storage provider, reducing the operating costs of the storage provider.

## Greenfield v0.1.2 - The maintenance testnet release.

[Greenfield Blockchain v0.1.2](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield/releases/tag/v0.1.2) and
[Storage Provider v0.1.2](https://github.com/bnb-chain/greenfield-storage-provider/releases/tag/v0.1.2)
was a regular maintenance testnet version of BNB Greenfield. This version fixed several bugs from the
previous version and introduced some features.

### Bugfix List
- Modification of Storage Fee Destination: Previously, storage fees were directed to the SP operator address.
 This has been adjusted to the funding address, ensuring smoother transactions and fee collection.
- Default SP Price Adjustment: To better reflect actual prices, the default prices in create_sp.json and payment.
 Param have been modified to align more closely with the current market rates.
- Fixing List Group Error: A crucial fix has been made to the listGroup function to adapt it to the new indexing
 structure of the group, which uses two levels of indexing.
- Fixing CLI Bugs: We have addressed some command usage issues, such as those relating to update-group-member and
 put-policy, and improved the description of some commands.

### Feature List
- Off-Chain-Auth Solution:  Implementing an off-chain-auth solution, which includes APIs for "request nonce",
 "update user key", and "verify off chain auth sig". This will greatly improve the user experience for Dapp users,
 eliminating the need for repetitive wallet popups for signatures.
- Path-style API and Upload Progress API: Introducing support for the path-style API and a new query upload progress API.
- Seal Object Metrics and Code Refinement: The TaskNode service now includes seal object metrics. We have also refined
 the replicate task and added some DB logs.
- Verify Permission API: The new verify permission API replaces the current chain interface, improving overall
 performance and reducing latency.
- Block Syncer TXHash & Juno Version Update: Updating the block syncer to add txhash info when exporting events.
 Additionally, updating the Juno version to support the new "stop serving" feature and included the SP module and GC function.
- Metadata Block Syncer Schema Update & ListExpiredBucketsBySp: Updating the block syncer schema according to changes
 on the chain and events. Also introducing a new method, ListExpiredBucketsBySp, to support GC operations within SP.
