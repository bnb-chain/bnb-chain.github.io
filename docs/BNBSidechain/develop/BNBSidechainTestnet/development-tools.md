# Development Tools 

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts development with BAS enables you to build your smart contracts for any use, including cryptocurrency exchanges, smart contract-based dApps, Decentralized Finance, and more. Smart contracts are programming logic that are executed automatically when a certain condition(s) are met. In BAS, smart contracts can be written in Solidity programming language. 
Please refer to the [official documentation of Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) for any queries.


## IDE and Libraries

Multiple IDEs and libraries can be used for developing and deploying smart contracts.

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/): powerful open-source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser. It is written in JavaScript and supports both usages in the browser, but runs locally and in a desktop version. Remix IDE has modules for testing, debugging, deploying smart contracts, and much more.

- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/teams/quickstart): development tool that allows users to compile, test, debug and deploy smart contracts.

- [Web3JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/): collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.
