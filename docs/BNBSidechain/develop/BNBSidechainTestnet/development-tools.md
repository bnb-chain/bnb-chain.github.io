# Development Tools 

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts development with BNB Sidechain enables you to build your smart contracts for any use, including cryptocurrency exchanges, smart contract-based dApps, Decentralized Finance, and more. Smart contracts are programming logic that are executed automatically when a certain condition(s) are met. In BNB Sidechain, smart contracts can be written in Solidity programming language. 
Please refer to the [official documentation of Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) for any queries.
