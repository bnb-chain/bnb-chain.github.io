# Unjail

`Jailed` validator nodes due to their malicious or bad behavior, may request for release by sending `side-unjail transactions` provided they passed initial validation. After release, to re-join the validator set again, the validator must wait for the following `UTC 0:00`. The `fees to unjail` a smart contract validator is **_1 BNB_**. Whereas, the fee for submitting a byzantine behavior evidence of a validator is **_10 BNB_**.

## Transaction Validation
*   Validator address must not be empty.
*  The side chain id exists.
*  Self-delegation of the validator exists and must be greater than the min-self-delegation setting by **_2,000 BNB_**.
*  Requestor is in 'jailed' state when requesting to be un-jailed.
*  Complete the required jailed term.
