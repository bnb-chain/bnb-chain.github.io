# How to join BNB Smart Chain Mainnet as Validator?

### Before You Start

Before you start, make sure you meet the hardware requirements for the validators nodes.

#### Choose Your Validator hardware

- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
- **IMPORTANT** 2 TB of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 250MB/S throughput, read latency <1ms
- 16 cores of CPU and 48 GB of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.3xlarge instance type on AWS, or c2-standard-8 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 10 MB/S


## Setting up Validator Node on Mainnet

### 1. Install BSC Fullnode

You can download the pre-build binaries from [release page](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest) or follow the instructions [here to set up a full node](fullnode.md).

**Download the config files**

Download `genesis.json` and `config.toml` by:

```bash
## mainet
wget --no-check-certificate  $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\" -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip
```

### 2. Write genesis state locally

```bash
geth --datadir node init genesis.json
```

You could see the following output:

```
INFO [05-19|14:53:17.468] Allocated cache and file handles         database=/Users/huangsuyu/Downloads/bsc/node/geth/chaindata cache=16.00MiB handles=16
INFO [05-19|14:53:17.498] Writing custom genesis block

INFO [05-19|14:53:17.524] Writing custom genesis block

INFO [05-19|14:53:17.528] Successfully wrote genesis state         database=lightchaindata hash=7d79cc…fb0d1e
```


### 3. Create Consensus Key

You need to create an account that represents a validator's consensus key. Use the following command to create a new account and set a password for that account:


!!! Warning
	Please do not share access to keystore to others.


```bash
geth account new --datadir ./node
```

This command will return the public address and the path to your private key. BACKUP of keyfile is necessory!

If you already have an account, use the seed phrase to recover it:

```bash
geth account import --datadir ./node
```

### 4. Start Validator Node

!!! Warning
	Please do not expose your RPC endpoints to public network.

```bash
## generate the consensus key and input the password
geth account new --datadir ./node
echo {your-password} > password.txt
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node --syncmode snap -unlock {your-validator-address} --password password.txt  --mine  --allow-insecure-unlock --cache 18000
```

### 5. Wait for node to sync

Your node should now be catching up with the network by replaying all the transactions from genesis and recreating the blockchain state locally. This will take a long time, so make sure you've set it up on a stable connection so you can leave while it syncs.

View the status of the network with [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/).

You can monitor the status from log: `$HOME/node/bsc.log` by default.

Congratulations! You've now successfully joined a network as a [full node](fullnode.md) operator.

### 6. Setup a data backup (recommended for the mainnet)

If you are connecting to an existing network for which you have a data backup (from a provider you trust), you can optionally load the backup into your node storage rather than syncing from scratch.

### 7. Declare Candidacy

You can use `bnbcli` binary to sen `create-validator` transaction, thus you can declare your candidacy.


* Download `bnbcli` from [GitHub](https://github.com/bnb-chain/node/releases)

Use `bnbcli` to create an account or recover an account, make sure the account get more than 10000 BNB.

Make sure your bsc validator have already catched up.

Command for create validator on mainnet:

```
bnbcli staking bsc-create-validator \
-side-cons-addr {validator address} \
--side-fee-addr {wallet address on BSC} \
--address-delegator {wallet address on BC} \
--side-chain-id bsc \
--amount 10000000000:BNB \
--commission-rate {10000000 represent 10%} \
--commission-max-rate {20000000 represent 20%} \
--commission-max-change-rate {500000000 represent 5%} \
--moniker {validator name} \
--details {validator detailed description} \
--identity {keybase identity} \
--website {website for validator} \
--from {key name} \
--chain-id Binance-Chain-Tigris \
--node https://dataseed5.defibit.io:443
```

Make sure that the `side-cons-addr` is the address you unlock when start the validator node.

Read the detailed manual [here](../stake/Staking.md) to understand other parameters.

Go to [explorer](https://explorer.bnbchain.org/) to verify your transactions.

## After Declaring Your Candidacy

### 1. Monitor node status

To get started quickly, run GethExporter in a Docker container.

```
docker run -it -d -p 9090:9090 \
  -e "GETH=http://mygethserverhere.com:8545" \
  hunterlong/gethexporter
```

### 2. Update validator profile

You can submit a PullRequest to this repository to update your information: <https://github.com/bnb-chain/validator-directory>
Reference: <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6976>


### 3. Publish Validator Information

Please submit a Pull Request to this repo <https://github.com/bnb-chain/validator-directory>

This repository is a place for validator candidates to give potential delegators a brief introduction about your team and infrastructure, and present your ecosystem contributions.

### 4. Stop Validating

You can stop mining new blocks by sending commands in `geth console`

Connect to your validator node with `geth attach ipc:path/to/geth.ipc`

```bash
miner.stop()
```

To resume validating,
```bash
miner.start()
```
