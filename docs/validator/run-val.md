# Run Validator

## Validator Hardware Requirements

### 1. Mainnet
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
- **IMPORTANT** 3T GB of free disk space, solid-state drive(SSD), gp3, 8k IOPS, 250MB/S throughput, read latency <1ms (if start with snap sync, it will need NVMe SSD)
- 16 cores of CPU and 64 gigabytes of memory (RAM)
- Suggest m5zn.3xlarge instance type on AWS, or c2-standard-16 on Google cloud.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 10 megabyte per second

### 2. Testnet
- CPU: 4core, Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8175M CPU @ 2.50GHz
- Memory: 16 GB
- Disk: ~1.5 TB
- Network Bandwidth: Upto 25 Gbps
- EBS Bandwidth: Upto 9.5 Gbps

## Setting up Validator Node

### 1. Install BSC Fullnode

Follow the instructions [here to set up a full node](fullnode.md).

### 2. Start Validator Node

There are 2 ways to start the validator node.

1. Using the command line as below:
!!! Warning
	Please do not expose your RPC endpoints to public network.

```bash
## generate the consensus key and input the password
echo {your-password to the mining account} > password.txt
echo {your-password for the bls wallet} > blspassword.txt
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node --syncmode snap -unlock {accounts to sign txs, including your mining account at least} --miner.etherbase {the address of your mining account} --password password.txt --blspassword blspassword.txt --mine --vote --allow-insecure-unlock --cache 18000
```
OR

2. Follow the below steps as an alternative:

- Step 1. Create a voting key first: `./geth bls account new --datadir <path>`

  - It will generate a wallet if it has not been created before, you have to keep the wallet password. If the wallet has been created before, you only need to provide the password.
  - Then it will create an account, you have to keep the account password too, the password length should >=10 characters.

    Note: Remember, you can create several accounts, but only one will be used.

- Step 2. You can view keys in the wallet by: `./geth bls account list --datadir <path>`

  - Remember the first one listed here will be used as the voting key, other keys are not used right now.

- Step 3. Update the config file: config.toml (Update `node` and `eth.miner` section in `config.toml` file.)

    - add 2 fields under `Node` section: `BLSPasswordFile` & `BLSWalletDir`.

      You need to provide the file: `/<path>/bls/blspassword.txt`, may generate it by: `echo <WalletPassword> >/<path>/bls/blspassword.txt` 
    - add 1 field in `[Eth.Miner]` section: `VoteEnable = true` to enable it.
      Or you may manually add an option on node start: `geth --vote` to enable it as well.

- The content of the config.toml for example:
  ```
    ...
    [Node]
    BLSPasswordFile = "/<path>/bls/blspassword.txt"
    BLSWalletDir = "/<path>/bls/wallet"
    ...
    [Eth.Miner]
    VoteEnable = true
    ...
  ```

**_Note: if the node prints: "BLS wallet did not exists.",
then you may add the flag to specify it: `â€“blswallet /<path>/bls/wallet`_**

- Step 4: restart
  - You may only provide the flag: `--vote`, if you did not specify it in config.toml
    Then you may go ahead, just restart the node.

## Post Running

### 1. Monitor node status

To get started quickly, run GethExporter in a Docker container.

```
docker run -it -d -p 9090:9090 \
  -e "GETH=http://mygethserverhere.com:8545" \
  hunterlong/gethexporter
```

### 2. Update validator profile

You can submit a PullRequest to this repository to update your information: <https://github.com/bnb-chain/validator-directory>
Reference: <https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6976>


### 3. Publish Validator Information

Please submit a Pull Request to this repo <https://github.com/bnb-chain/validator-directory>

This repository is a place for validator candidates to give potential delegators a brief introduction about your team and infrastructure, and present your ecosystem contributions.

### 4. Stop Validating

You can stop mining new blocks by sending commands in **geth console**

Connect to your validator node with **geth attach ipc:path/to/geth.ipc**

```bash
miner.stop()
```

To resume validating,
```bash
miner.start()
```
