BNB Chain is a leading blockchain ecosystem designed to support the growing demands of the decentralized web (Web3). Offering a unique combination of speed, scalability, and affordability, BNB Chain has become a popular choice for developers building decentralized applications (DApps) and for users seeking to participate in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

## **Key Features and Benefits**

* **Compatibility with the Ethereum Ecosystem**

    Developers can easily port their existing Ethereum-based projects to BNB Chain, benefiting from its enhanced performance.

* **Massive User Base**

    BNB Chain Handle the largest daily active users and the highest peak EVM transactions with economical fees.

* **Strongest Ecosystem**

    It is Supported by a robust ecosystem of top-tier RPC plants, wallets, blockchain explorers, data indices, and substantial grants.

* **Thriving DeFi Ecosystem**

    BNB Chain boasts a vast array of DeFi applications, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, yield farming platforms, and more.

* **Community-Driven Growth**

    BNB Chain is supported by a vibrant community of developers, validators, and users who contribute to its ongoing development and expansion.

* **Most Diversified Assets APIs**

    Full support on all popular tokens. The greatest opportunity for composability.

## **Chains**

BNB Chain is composed of three blockchains - BNB Smart Chain (BSC), opBNB and BNB Greenfield.
Powering and coordinating the ecosystem is the BNB token. Along with fueling transactions on BNB Chain, the BNB token also acts as a governance token.
Within this ecosystem, the ownership, usage, and monetization of data are possible for all users and participants in the BNB Chain ecosystem.

## **Use Cases**

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**

    BNB Chain is a hub for DeFi activities, providing users with access to a wide range of financial products and services, all powered by blockchain technology.

* **LSD and Restaking**

    BNB Chain is secured by more than 20M BNB staking and 20K delegators. The development for LSD and Restaking has been bolstered by a substantial amount of assets and a solid user base.

* **Gaming and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**

    The platform's fast transaction speeds and low fees make it ideal for gaming and NFT applications. opBNB further enhances this capability.

* **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**

    Developers can build and deploy a variety of DApps on BNB Chain, leveraging its robust infrastructure and growing user base.

* **Data Storage and Management**

    BNB Greenfield opens up new possibilities for decentralized data storage and management, catering to a wide range of use cases.

* **AI with blockchain technology**

    With the growing demand for Artificial Intelligence or AI, there is now more than ever a need to integrate AI with blockchain technology to reap its benefits. BNB Chain is making this integration a reality by providing a robust platform that easily integrates blockchain and AI.
