**Step 2.** Once you have downloaded and installed the app, open Trust Wallet and tap on "Create a new wallet".<br/>
In the next step you will receive your 12 word recovery phrase, which acts as a backup for you funds.

IMPORTANT: There is no way to change or recover your 12 word phrase if it's lost or forgotten.<br/>
If you lose your recovery phrase you will lose your funds with it.<br/>
Trust Wallet is completely different from traditional bank accounts.<br/>
You are the true owner of your “Money”, Trust Wallet can never access your coins.<br/>
It is technically not possible for us to recover wallets since we do not have access to your recovery phrase
**(only your 12 word recovery phrase can be used to restore access to your wallet)**.<br/>

**Step 3.** Before you finish the step of creating the wallet, verify that you wrote down the 12 word phrase in the correct order.

**IMPORTANT:** It is strongly recommended to do your backup now and [store it somewhere safe](https://help.trustwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016509753-Best-Practices-to-Store-Recovery-Phrase-and-Private-Keys)!
