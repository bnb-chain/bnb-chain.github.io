## What is BSC?
BSC is the abbreviation of BNB Smart Chain. The chain adopts PoSA (Proof of Staked Authority), which means holders of BNB (BSC's native token) vote to select 21 validators that are responsible for on-chain transaction verification and block production.
 
Since BSC is EMV-compatible, developers can easily deploy smart contracts and build DApps on the chain. Compared with Ethereum, BSC has lower gas fees and faster transaction settlement with lower security guarantees.
 
With imToken wallet, we do not only support BSC DApps and watching token balances but also the DeFi Portfolio feature, providing a holistic BSC experience.
