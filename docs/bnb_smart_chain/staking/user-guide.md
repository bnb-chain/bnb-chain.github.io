Leverage the BNB staking dApp for streamlined management of your stakes. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for using the dApp on both BSC testnet and mainnet.

- **Testnet**: [https://testnet-staking.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-staking](https://testnet-staking.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-staking)
- **Mainnet**: [https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-staking](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-staking)

## Connect Wallet

## Delegate Stakes

1. Select a validator to delegate your stakes to. Detailed information about each validator is available on their respective pages.
2. Click the `Delegate` button to initiate a new delegation.

## Redelegate Stakes

On the `My Staking` page, you can manage your existing delegations.

>Note: A redelegation fee of 0.002% applies to discourage frequent switching between validators.

1. Click `Redelegate` to shift your stake to a different validator.
