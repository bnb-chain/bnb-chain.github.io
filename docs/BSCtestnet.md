## What is a Testnet?

The testnet is a test environment for BNB Smart Chain network, run by the BNB Chain development community, which is open to developers.

## What is the Testnet good for?

- Develop applications and try tutorials on BNB Smart Chain without the potential to lose your own assets.
- Test your applications against new versions of BNB Smart Chain.
