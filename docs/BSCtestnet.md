# BSC Testnet

## What is a Testnet?

The testnet is a test environment for BNB Smart Chain network, run by the BNB Chain development community, which is open to developers.

The validators on the testnet are mainly from the development team.


You can connect a node to the testnet by downloading the node binary and testnet configuration from [https://github.com/bnb-chain/node/releases](https://github.com/bnb-chain/node/releases).

There is also a [web wallet](https://testnet.binance.org/en/) that can directly interact with the DEX testnet.

## What is the Testnet good for?

- Create your test address and get your testnet funds.
- Develop applications and try tutorials on BNB Smart Chain without the potential to lose your own assets.
- Test your applications against new versions of BNB Smart Chain.
- Analyze blockchain data on a smaller, non-trivial data set compared to the public network.
