# How to Contribute to BNB Chain Documentations Project

Your contributions to the BNB Chain will help build a fast and secure decentralized digital asset exchange.

We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute changes that help the BNB Chain grow and thrive. There are a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow so that we can merge your changes quickly.

**Steps for Contributing on GitHub**
- Make sure you have a GitHub account.
- Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Minor Changes
- Documentation
- For small changes to comments and documentation, it is not always necessary to create a new GitHub issue. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit with 'doc' instead of an issue number.

**Finding things to work on**
The first place to start is always looking over the current GitHub issues for the project you are interested in contributing to. Issues marked with [help wanted][help-wanted] are usually pretty self-contained and a good place to get started.

Of course, feel free to create a new issue if you think something needs to be added or fixed.

**Making Changes**
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually the master branch. Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
- Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes and make sure all tests pass.

**Submitting Changes**
- Submit a pull request to the docs repository in the BNB Chain organization.
- Include a descriptive [commit message][commit-msg].
- Changes contributed via pull request should focus on a single issue at a time.
- Rebase your local changes against the master branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise.
