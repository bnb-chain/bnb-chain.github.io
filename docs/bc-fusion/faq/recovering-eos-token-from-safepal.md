title: Recovering EOS Tokens from SafePal Wallet After BEP2 Shutdown - BNBChain Fusion FAQs  
---

### Why can’t I recover my EOS tokens after the BEP2 network shutdown?

The BNB Beacon Chain (BEP2) was officially shut down, and all recovery of assets like EOS requires using the **official token recovery dApp**. This dApp only supports specific wallets like **Trust Wallet** and **BNB Chain Wallet Extension**. If your tokens remained on BEP2 and were **not cross-chain bound**, they are not eligible for recovery.

### My EOS tokens are on a SafePal hardware wallet. Can I use that for recovery?

Unfortunately, **SafePal hardware wallets are not currently supported** by the official token recovery dApp. Even though you can sign transactions with SafePal, the dApp requires wallet extensions that can directly interface with it (e.g., Trust Wallet Extension or BNB Chain Wallet).

### What if I have my seed phrase?

If your SafePal wallet was created using a **seed phrase + passphrase** and you’ve forgotten the passphrase, you **cannot recover the wallet in another supported service** like Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Both the seed and passphrase are required for access.

### Can I still use the SafePal wallet to recover EOS?

Not through the **official recovery process**. The recovery dApp doesn't support direct connection to SafePal. Even though you can sign transactions, that isn’t enough to complete recovery without compatibility with the recovery tool.

### Is there any workaround?

At this time, **no official workaround** exists. If you **cannot remember the passphrase** and **cannot import the wallet into a supported service**, your access to the recovery tool is blocked.

You can try:

- Continuing to check with **SafePal support** for any recovery options.
- Monitoring for future updates to the **token recovery dApp** that might include SafePal support.

### Can BNB Chain team recover my tokens?

No. Token recovery is **only possible through self-custody**, meaning **you must control and access your wallet**. If you cannot provide the full credentials (seed + passphrase), no team or admin can assist with recovery due to decentralization and security policies.

### Why wasn’t this communicated earlier?

The BNB Beacon Chain sunset was publicly announced along with recovery guidelines. However, **not all hardware wallets were supported**, and **users were advised to migrate assets before the shutdown**. Unfortunately, if you missed the window and cannot access your wallet via supported tools, recovery is no longer possible through official channels.

> **Important:** Always store your seed phrase and any additional passphrases securely. Use wallets and services that provide wide compatibility when dealing with network migrations.
