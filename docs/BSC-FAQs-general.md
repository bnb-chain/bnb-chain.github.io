# BNB Smart Chain  FAQs

### What is BNB Smart Chain?

BNB Smart Chain brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication with BNB Beacon Chain using an innovative consensus of Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA).

### Why is BNB Smart Chain designed as a separate chain from BNB Beacon Chain?

The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. Even if that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on Tendermint, based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major RPC implementation of BNB Beacon Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.

### Where will the published whitepaper be found?

The whitepaper can be found at <https://github.com/bnb-chain/whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md>. Your feedback is more than welcome.

### Where can I take a look at the BNB Smart Chain code? Is there a GitHub repository?

The codebase of BSC is open-sourced here:

* <https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc>
* <https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-relayer>
* <https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-relayer-config>
* <https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-genesis-contract>
* <https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-double-sign-sdk>
* <https://github.com/bnb-chain/oracle-relayer>

## What is the consensus model of BSC?

BNB Smart Chain is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability to BNB Beacon Chain. BNB Smart Chain relies on a system of 50 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. For more details, refer [here](learn/consensus.md).

###  How to recover if you choose the wrong network type?

Please read this [guide](./wallet/withdraw-en.md)

### How does BNB Smart Chain work? What are the architecture and consensus used?

BNB Smart Chain relies on a system of 50 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.

There will be fewer validators on the BNB Smart Chain testnet.

### Can you tell me more about Proof of Staked Authority(PoSA)? What is it?

PoSA is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on staking-based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner

### What are the benefits for developers to build on BNB Smart Chain?

### What are Pegged tokens on BNB Smart Chain?

Soon after the launch of BNB Beacon Chain, BNB Chain issued several pegged BEP2 tokens that are running on other blockchain networks, including BTC (BTCB), ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, and ONT. These tokens are backed by real tokens locked in public addresses and have allowed users to benefit from both the volatility of these tokens as well as the fast transfer and trading experience of BNB Beacon Chain.

## Which dApps are deployed on BSC?
Refer to [here](https://bnbproject.org/) to learn about the different projects deployed on BSC.

## What to do if I transferred funds to the exchange wallet but the exchange doesn't support the BSC chain?

Please be careful while doing transactions to other exchanges to check if they support or accept deposits through BSC or not. The confirmed transaction on the blockchain cannot be reverted as we also don't have any access to the wallet address.

## What to do in case of a wrong network withdrawal issue?

Please try to use the wallet app which supports both BSC and ETH networks in it. So that you can access any network with the same address and transfer your funds out of the wrong network.


## What to do in case of a Missing memo or wrong memo?
Please try to contact the support of the receiver address to help with the deposit. If it's an exchange wallet address then contact them with the correct memo.

## How to track Cross-chain transfer tx From BC to BSC?

1. Get the Cross-chain transfer transaction hash of the BNB Beacon Chain

For example <https://explorer.bnbchain.org/tx/8B9B066BAF9DC1C233A9D316C75E8139B985518868C1120B656C5B3EBAC7C498>

Please make sure the “Transaction Type” is “Cross-chain transfer out”

![img](./assets/bsc_faqs_general/Txn_Type_Cross-chain_transfer_out.png)

2. Get Destination Address

The “TxHash on BSC” is linked to BNB smart chain explorer

![img](./assets/bsc_faqs_general/txn_hash_receiver_add_bsc.png)

For example https://www.bscscan.com/tx/0x43980b4f9ae4c03685dd61172d23ccae07eb8abb0d677c579bfc7059e447ead9

If "status" is a success, it means this transaction is successful. 

The tokens were sent from "BSC: Token Hub" to the receiver address.
