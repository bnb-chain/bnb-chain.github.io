We target to achieve 1 second block times, with 1 confirmation finality.</li><li>Low cost: in both fees and liquidity cost.</li><li>Easy user experience</li><li>Fair trading: minimize front-running, to the extent possible.</li><li>Evolvable: able to develop with forever-improving technology stack, architecture, and ideas.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-can-you-do-on-bnb-beacon-chain-">What can you do on BNB Beacon Chain ?<a href="#what-can-you-do-on-bnb-beacon-chain-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What can you do on BNB Beacon Chain ?" title="Direct link to What can you do on BNB Beacon Chain ?">​</a></h3><p>You can:</p><ul><li>Send and receive BNB</li><li>Issue new tokens</li><li>Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze tokens</li><li>Propose to create trading pairs between two different tokens</li><li>Send orders to buy or sell assets through trading pairs created on the chain</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="will-bnb-beacon-chain--introduce-more-features-and-transaction-types-in-the-future">Will BNB Beacon Chain  introduce more features and transaction types in the future?<a href="#will-bnb-beacon-chain--introduce-more-features-and-transaction-types-in-the-future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Will BNB Beacon Chain  introduce more features and transaction types in the future?" title="Direct link to Will BNB Beacon Chain  introduce more features and transaction types in the future?">​</a></h3><p>Yes, BNB Beacon Chain  team and community would cherish the technology advancements and recommended trends and strive to make circulation of assets and value easier and easier.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-native-coin-on-bnb-beacon-chain-">What is the native coin on BNB Beacon Chain ?<a href="#what-is-the-native-coin-on-bnb-beacon-chain-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the native coin on BNB Beacon Chain ?" title="Direct link to What is the native coin on BNB Beacon Chain ?">​</a></h3><p>The Build N Build Coin, BNB, is the native asset on BNB Beacon Chain . There are 200MM BNB coins in total.
There will be no mining. The existing coin burns and freezes will still be in effect on the new
BNB Beacon Chain  blockchain.</p><p>The exact number of BNB coins will be destroyed based on the same number of BNB ERC20 tokens
that have already been destroyed.</p><p>Since BNB Beacon Chain  is live, all BNB ERC20 tokens will be swapped for BNB Beacon Chain  coins. All
users who hold BNB ERC20 tokens can deposit them to Binance.com, and upon withdrawal, the new
BNB Beacon Chain  native coins will be sent to their new wallets.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-i-register-on-bnb-beacon-chain-dex-and-start-trading">How can I register on BNB Beacon Chain /DEX and start trading?<a href="#how-can-i-register-on-bnb-beacon-chain-dex-and-start-trading" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How can I register on BNB Beacon Chain /DEX and start trading?" title="Direct link to How can I register on BNB Beacon Chain /DEX and start trading?">​</a></h3><p>There is no need to register. All you need is a BNB Beacon Chain  address, which can be generated with
any <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/bnb-chain.github.io/blob/master/docs/beaconchain/wallets.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet</a> that supports BNB Beacon Chain . Then you can trade BNB or other assets stored on that address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-i-send-orders-on-binance-dex">How can I send orders on Binance DEX?<a href="#how-can-i-send-orders-on-binance-dex" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How can I send orders on Binance DEX?" title="Direct link to How can I send orders on Binance DEX?">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="order">Order<a href="#order" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Order" title="Direct link to Order">​</a></h4><p>On Binance DEX, you can send &quot;new order&quot; messages to buy or sell certain assets. You can also
send &quot;cancel&quot; messages to cancel existing open orders.</p><p>You can use a wallet to send new orders and cancels. Binance DEX also provides API for automated trading.</p><p>In Binance DEX v1.0, the order message contains:</p><ul><li>Symbol: trading pair on the chain</li><li>Side: buy or sell</li><li>Price: only limit price orders are supported in BNB Beacon Chain  v1.0</li><li>Amount</li><li>Time In Force: Binance DEX supports <code>Immediate Or Cancel</code> (IOC) and <code>Good Till Expiry</code> (GTE)
orders. GTE orders can quote on the exchange until they are filled by the opposite orders satisfying
the limit price, or canceled by client themselves, or expire after 72 hours after 00:00 (UTC).
Check the &quot;What is <code>Order Expire</code>&quot; section of the FAQ for more information.</li></ul><p>Network nodes examine orders to ensure they are valid. Once the orders are accepted, they are
booked on the next block, and get matched accordingly.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-immediate-or-cancel-order">What is <code>Immediate Or Cancel order</code>?<a href="#what-is-immediate-or-cancel-order" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-is-immediate-or-cancel-order" title="Direct link to what-is-immediate-or-cancel-order">​</a></h4><p>Immediate Or Cancel is a special order type. Once the order is accepted into a block, Immediate Or
Cancel orders only exist in this block round. The order may get filled to zero, or partially or fully
filled by other orders, and then will become expired and removed from the order book right away.
As a result, it will not be tradable in the next round of matching. A small fee will be charged
for the network usage, if there is no fill at all for the order (deemed as no intention to trade).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="match">Match<a href="#match" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Match" title="Direct link to Match">​</a></h4><p>Binance DEX does all of its matching on the blockchain, i.e. all nodes perform the matches and
expect the same result. This is to ensure the maximum transparency and to mitigate the chance
for front-running, even from the block producers. The matching infrastructure is expected to
evolve and grow in capacity as time progresses.</p><p>Binance DEX doesn&#x27;t do continuous matching as most centralized exchanges do. Instead, it matches
using periodic auction matching for all the existing open orders received in the past and the
latest blocks. The match logic is explained in more detail later.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trade">Trade<a href="#trade" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Trade" title="Direct link to Trade">​</a></h4><p>Once the orders are filled, the corresponding assets will be automatically moved into buyers&#x27;
addresses. The confirmation is instant and no need to wait for further blocks (i.e. T+0 block).
Buyers can use the bought asset right away, either send it to another address or trade it again.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-order-expire">What is <code>Order Expire</code>?<a href="#what-is-order-expire" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-is-order-expire" title="Direct link to what-is-order-expire">​</a></h4><p>Orders accepted by Binance DEX will either get filled with other orders or remain in the order book,
but they will not stay on the order book forever. These orders will expire and be removed from the
order book after the 1st midnight (UTC) after 72 hours once the order gets accepted. A small fee
will be charged for the network usage, if there is no fill at all for the order (deemed as no intention to trade).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-can-i-see-my-assets-and-trades">Where can I see my assets and trades?<a href="#where-can-i-see-my-assets-and-trades" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where can I see my assets and trades?" title="Direct link to Where can I see my assets and trades?">​</a></h4><p>You can always use wallets that support BNB Beacon Chain  to check your asset balances, open orders,
and (optionally) order/trade history. BNB Beacon Chain  Explorer is another tool to check balances
and transactions.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-can-i-see-my-order-on-the-blockchain-after-i-send-it">When can I see my order on the blockchain after I send it?<a href="#when-can-i-see-my-order-on-the-blockchain-after-i-send-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When can I see my order on the blockchain after I send it?" title="Direct link to When can I see my order on the blockchain after I send it?">​</a></h4><p>It depends. Normally, if you connect to one of the Accelerated Nodes, your orders should get
accepted and booked into a block in 1-3 seconds. If the order price is marketable, the order
will be filled and trades will come back in about similar time. If you send the order from far-way
(self-setup full node), or there is heavy network traffic, the order may take longer to reach
a Validator (block producer).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-fee-structure">What is the Fee Structure?<a href="#what-is-the-fee-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the Fee Structure?" title="Direct link to What is the Fee Structure?">​</a></h4><p>Fees are charged and shared among the block producers (i.e. Validators) to run the network,
in order to pay for the network usage and prevent abuse and attack. Since all user transactions,
include transfer, new order, cancel etc, they are all recorded in blocks and chain state, the fee will be
shared among different transactions. New orders are exempt from fees to encourage usage and larger
trades will be charged more for their benefits from the liquidity provided in the network.
Order Expire and Cancel are also charged with a fee if they fail to provide any liquidity. The current fee table is <a href="/docs/trading-spec/">here</a></p><p>Besides the fees, <strong>no other gas will be charged.</strong></p><p>Fees can be paid in any asset, but the network will charge BNB first and apply a discount if the
address has BNB balance.</p><p>The fee is subject to periodical review and adjustment, after agreement from validators, via a
proposal-vote procedure. See a fee-change proposal <a href="https://explorer.bnbchain.org/tx/B1E78D8275598CB0538C716997EEDD2F1198B82F4D73959C5BF69CBAF4281240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p><ul><li>Trade fee is calculated based on trade notional value, while fees for other transactions are fixed.</li><li>It is free to send a new GET order, cancel a partially filled order, or expire a partially filled order.</li><li>Non-Trade related transactions will be charged with a fee when the transactions happen, and can
only be paid in BNB. The transaction will be rejected if the address does not have enough BNB.</li><li>Trade-related transactions will be charged with a fee when an order is filled, or
canceled/expired/IOC-expired with no fills. If there is enough BNB to pay, BNB fee structure will
be used, otherwise, non-BNB fee structure will be used instead.</li><li>If the whole order value and free balance for the receiving asset are not enough to pay the fee,

a series of qualified Validators. This is similar to the architectures of several existing
popular blockchain platforms such as EOS and NEO.
The process for setting up validators among different entities on BNB Beacon Chain  is currently being defined.

After the latest “Archimedes” upgrade, <a href="https://https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP3.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BEP3</a> was introduced and it defines native transactions to support <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hash Timelock Contract (HTLC)</a> on BNB Beacon Chain  and it also to defines the infrastructure standard and procedure to use HTLC for inter-chain <a href="https://www.binance.vision/blockchain/atomic-swaps-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">atomic swap</a> to easily swap tokens on different chains.

price-discovery is still to use single order book. This single order book is managed and replicated across all
full nodes with the same, deterministic matching logic.</p><p>Simply allowing trading between two assets seems easy enough, however it is expensive for not only the network
but also its users in long term (and liquidity costs can be much larger). In order to efficiently use the
network, BNB Beacon Chain  only list assets against BNB and other widely accepted market quote assets.</p><p>After an asset is issued, which costs a small fee,
anyone can &quot;propose&quot; to all validators to list it against particular quote assets.
Validators then vote to accept the proposal.
A deposit is taken to prevent network abuse.
Once the proposal is accepted, the owner of the base asset can list the trading pair.</p><p>For more information about this process please check the <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/bnb-chain.github.io/blob/master/docs/beaconchain/list.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing guide</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-a-third-party-integrate-with-bnb-beacon-chain-and-binance-dex">How would a third-party integrate with BNB Beacon Chain and Binance DEX?<a href="#how-would-a-third-party-integrate-with-bnb-beacon-chain-and-binance-dex" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How would a third-party integrate with BNB Beacon Chain and Binance DEX?" title="Direct link to How would a third-party integrate with BNB Beacon Chain and Binance DEX?">​</a></h3><p>A wallet provider may choose to only support the feature set of BNB Beacon Chain , which would just
