# BSC Mainnet

## What is Mainnet?
Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain). 

BNB Smart Chain's mainnet can be used for deploying actual dApps on the BSC blockchain ad perform real transactions. Since this is the actual network, you will require to purchase real BNB tokens to perform different operations on the network. 

## How to Get BNB
There are multiple ways to purchase BNB Tokens for use on the mainnet. Other than the official [Binance Extension Wallet](binance.md), BNB Smart Chain supports several popular wallets like [MetaMask](wallet/metamask.md) and [TrustWallet](wallet/trustwallet.md), to learn more about the supported wallets refer [here](Wallet.md). For a list of tutorials on how to use different supported wallets with BNB Smart Chain, refer [here](wallets/wallet-tutorial-overview). 

## How to Access BSC
There are multiple ways to access the BSC mainnet. One possible method is to join the mainnet as a [full node](validator/guideline-mainnet.md). You can also use the RPC endpoints specified [here](rpc.md) to connect to the mainnet. RPC endpoints may be used to interact with a node directly over HTTP or websockets. Using RPC, you may perform low-level operations like executing ABCI queries, viewing network/consensus state or broadcasting a transaction. RPC endpoints are also used with web wallets like [MetaMask](wallet/metamask.md) to connect to the BSC mainnet.

To learn more about the ecosystem and the different development tools like APIs, IDEs, wallets, etc., that are available on the BSC network, you can refer [here](learn/ecosystem.md). You can visit [BNBProject](https://bnbproject.org/#/) or [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/binance-smart-chain) to view real-time ranking and tracking of BSC projects.

## How to Build on BSC
You can build deploy [smart contracts](remix.md), [NFTs](nft-metadata-standard.md), [BEP20 Tokens](BEP20.md), and [BEP20 Upgradable Contracts](proxy.md) on the BNB Smart Chain.
