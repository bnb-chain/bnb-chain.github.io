# Ledger Nano S Usage Guide

This guide will show you how to use your Ledger Nano S hardware wallet with Beacon Chain  and Binance DEX.

> Please Note: When using a Ledger to secure your Beacon Chain  wallet, your private keys are not exposed and never leave the device, guarding you against loss, malware and phishing attacks.
Therefore, using a hardware wallet device such as the Ledger Nano S is strongly recommended over using a less secure wallet storage method that relies on your computerâ€™s local storage, such as Keystore File.

## Requirements

In order to use a Ledger device with Beacon Chain and Binance DEX, you will need:

- Supported web browser: Chrome (including Brave, Vivaldi, and other Chromium variants), Opera or Firefox
- Access to the Beacon Chain  web wallet (https://binance.org/unlock) using your web browser
- Initialized Ledger Nano S device with firmware version 1.5.5 or newer
- The Ledger Live application installed on your computer for app installation

## App Installation Instructions

1) Plug in and unlock your Ledger device, open Ledger Live on your computer, then open the "Manager" panel.
