# Beacon Chain FAQ

## What is Beacon Chain, or Binance DEX?

Beacon Chain is the blockchain initially developed by Binance and community. Binance DEX, which is disabled now, is the
decentralized exchange module developed on top of the Beacon Chain blockchain.

## What is the design principle of Beacon Chain?

The main focuses for the design of Beacon Chain are:

- No custody of funds: traders maintain control of their private keys and funds.
- High performance: low latency, high throughput for a large user base, and high liquidity trading.
We target to achieve 1 second block times, with 1 confirmation finality.
- Low cost: in both fees and liquidity cost.
- Easy user experience: as friendly as Binance.com.
- Fair trading: minimize front-running, to the extent possible.
- Evolvable: able to develop with forever-improving technology stack, architecture, and ideas.

## What can you do on Beacon Chain?

You can:

- Send and receive BNB
- Issue new tokens
- Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze tokens

## Will Beacon Chain introduce more features and transaction types in the future?

Yes, Beacon Chain team and community would cherish the technology advancements and recommended trends and strive to make circulation of assets and value easier and easier.

## What is the native coin on Beacon Chain?

The Binance Coin, BNB, is the native asset on Beacon Chain. There are 200MM BNB coins in total.
There will be no mining. The existing coin burns and freezes will still be in effect on the new
Beacon Chain blockchain.

The exact number of BNB coins will be destroyed based on the same number of BNB ERC20 tokens
that have already been destroyed.

Since Beacon Chain is live, all BNB ERC20 tokens will be swapped for Beacon Chain coins. All
users who hold BNB ERC20 tokens can deposit them to Binance.com, and upon withdrawal, the new
Beacon Chain native coins will be sent to their new wallets.

## What is the current Fee Table on Beacon Chain Mainnet?

## Information provided through API and their usage

### Is there any limit to using the API to send orders or check market data?

Yes, there are rate limits to ensure there is no waste or abuse of the network infrastructure.<br/>
Please check the API documentation.

### What does Wallet and API cost to use?

No fee or commission at all (free to use).

## I forgot the private key for my address, how can I get it back?

Sorry, you cannot. Owner of the address takes full responsibility for the private key protection.
Beacon Chain and official wallets do not have your private key.

## My private key got stolen by hackers, how can I recover my assets?

Sorry, you take full responsibility of your private key ownership and protection. Beacon Chain
and official wallets will not record, or transfer out your private key.

## What is the Accelerated Node?

While users can submit transactions and most of the queries via normal, self-run full nodes.<br/>
Accelerated Node provides more secure and faster lines to access Beacon Chain.

Accelerated Node is special infrastructure built around Validator to facilitate accelerated transaction
routing and provide richer, faster user interfaces. There are always several Accelerated Nodes running
at the same time around the world (owned by different organizations) and you are encouraged to choose
one of them to use, or allow your Wallet choose one randomly.<br/>
For rapid API access, you'd better stay with one Accelerated Node to get better performance.

## How can I issue an asset?

Anyone can pay a fee and issue an asset as Token on Beacon Chain, as long as they provide
proper information for the fields below, and then execute the command through the command line or http interfaces.

- Name: a description string of less than 21 characters
- Symbol: an identifier string less than 9 characters, which must be composed of [0-9A-Z]
- Total Supply: a positive number less than or equal to 90 billions
- Mint-able: whether the token can increase Total Supply in later time or not

## What is the consensus algorithm used on Beacon Chain?

Beacon Chain uses BFT and PoS (upcoming) based consensus mechanism to produce blocks among
a series of qualified Validators. This is similar to the architectures of several existing
popular blockchain platforms such as EOS and NEO.
The process for setting up validators among different entities on Beacon Chain is currently being defined. More details will be shared at a later date.

## Can I run a full node for Beacon Chain?

Yes, you can. A full node contains all the information and application logic for Beacon Chain.
It can receive and broadcast blocks and transactions with other full nodes and even validators.
The only exception is it will not participate in the consensus if the full node is not a Validator.

## Does Beacon Chain support Smart Contracts?

No. This was an intentional design decision to improve the performance of the system and eliminate
having to support unnecessary features.

If you have certain must-have feature-s, it might be added as a native implementation instead of using smart contract.<br/>
Feel free to talk to Binance community.

## How can I transfer tokens, such as Bitcoin, from other blockchains onto Beacon Chain?

Right now, there are 2 ways to transfer tokens cross-chain:

1. via interoperability among different chains. After the latest “Archimedes” upgrade, [BEP3](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP3.md) was introduced and it defines native transactions to support [Hash Timelock Contract (HTLC)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts) on Beacon Chain and it also to defines the infrastructure standard and procedure to use HTLC for inter-chain [atomic swap](https://www.binance.vision/blockchain/atomic-swaps-explained) to easily swap tokens on different chains. Beacon Chain development community has finished implementing its solution for BEP3 with BEP2 and ERC20 tokens and decided to open-source all of the key components, including：
*  [smart-contract solution](https://github.com/binance-chain/bep3-smartcontracts) that supports Atomic Peg Swap (APS) for Ethereum. Please note that this solution is already audited by 3rd party.
* [deputy process](https://github.com/binance-chain/bep3-deputy) written in GoLang that handles swap activities

Any developer is welcome to test the solutions in testnet and then use them in mainnet.

2. via Binance.com. [Binance](https://wwww.binance.com),the largest cryptocurrency exchange, has issued a number of crypto-pegged tokens on Beacon Chain (BEP2 token format): [BEP2 Bitcoin](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/BTCB-1DE), [BEP2 BCH](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/BCH-1FD),[BEP2 XRP](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/XRP-BF2), [BEP2 LTC](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/LTC-F07). Pegged tokens such as [BEP2 Bitcoin](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/BTCB-1DE), are 100% backed by the native coin in [reserve](https://btc.com/3LYJfcfHPXYJreMsASk2jkn69LWEYKzexb). The reserve addresses are published for anyone to audit. Read this [blog](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/347360878904684544/Introducing-BitcoinPegged-Token-on-Binance-Chain) to learn about the reserved address. Users are free to convert between native and BEP2 Bitcoin via deposit/withdrawal. This has a higher degree of ease-of-use for most traders. More swap channels will be provided on partner wallets soon.

Atomic swap and this centralized approach are not exclusive to other decentralized approaches, which can also be implemented in parallel. There are many cross-chain solutions being developed and we are very interested in them.

Please do __NOT__ try to transfer anything on existing network to Beacon Chain testnet, you may experience loss by doing so, because testnet doesn't run with real coins.

## How would a third-party integrate with Beacon Chain and Binance DEX?

A wallet provider may choose to support the feature set of Beacon Chain, which would cover wallets, addresses, balances, transfers and etc.<br/>
