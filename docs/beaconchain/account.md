# Account and Balance

Each account contains cryptographic authentication info. It is created by a user of the blockchain. It also includes public key, address, and account number/sequence number for replay protection. Whenever a new address receives an asset, the corresponding transaction would create an `Account` for that address, which contains balances across all assets that are owned on this address.

The balance (the amount of tokens) of each asset is composed of 3 different parts:

- Available: the amount of tokens that can be transferred, and spent to swap (buy) other assets
- Locked: the amount of tokens that has been used in any outstanding orders. Once the order terminates (either filled, canceled or expired), the locked amount will decrease.
- Frozen: the amount of tokens that has been frozen via `Freeze` transactions.

You can query the account info with the following command on mainnet:

```shell
./bnbcli account <your-address> --chain-id Binance-Chain-Tigris --node https://dataseed5.defibit.io:443 --indent --trust-node
```

Example output:

Please note that the amount is boosted by **e^8** for the decimal part.

```json

```

From the output you can see that this account `account_number` is 406226 and its `sequence` is 29.
This is the important information about this account.

## Create Account

There are two ways of creating an account on BNB Chain : creating a key in a web wallet and creating a key via `bnbcli`. Please make sure you backup your mnemonic.

### Web Wallet

+ You can create a key via [web wallet](https://testnet.binance.org/create)

Follow the instructions and set your password (password is used to unlock the keystore file that you will get here):

![create key](../assets/create_key_1.png)

Then click `Download Keystore File` and you will get a keystore file and be directed to mnemonic page. Make sure to back up mnemonic here as it will be used to restore your key.

![create key](../assets/create_key_2.png)

+ You can restore your key [here](https://testnet.binance.org/unlock)

Choose `Mnenomic Phrase`, paste the mnemonic you get above and set your session password:

![create key](../assets/create_key_3.png)

Your wallet will be unlocked and you can get your address here (for this example it is `tbnb14m2gcdjq7aqkdtu2m9qrqrl8eevzpqfj9xc0uu`):

![create key](../assets/create_key_4.png)


### Account Management With Bnbcli

You can get `bnbcli` by following instructions [here](../api-reference/cli.md).

You should get `mnemonic` if you follow the instructions above. You can restore you key via `bnbcli` or `tbnbcli`.

+ Restore your key

```bash
$ ./bnbcli keys add test --recover
Enter a passphrase for your key:
Repeat the passphrase:
> Enter your recovery seed phrase:

NAME:	TYPE:	ADDRESS:						PUBKEY:

```

+ Create a new key

You can also create a new key and you will get a new mnemonic with `bnbcli` or `tbnbcli`.
```bash
$ ./bnbcli keys add new_key
Enter a passphrase for your key:
Repeat the passphrase:
NAME:	TYPE:	ADDRESS:						PUBKEY:
new_key	local	tbnb1c5dxrdn9xuw0njwcyevzyjrza550z5au8v0hyz	bnbp1addwnpepqwdsud63f5rq2wkgrezlvzdauf4x7wp3defzvhrzkwdzl7p0n6uk666ghpa
**Important** write this seed phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

### Query Account Balance

Please note that the amount is boosted by **e^8** for the decimal part.

Example on **mainnet**:

```bash
$  ./bnbcli account bnc1wwgakqy32m7vdnlf00pctf9hnaak37eh7wkmqa --trust-node --chain-id Binance-Chain-Tigris --node https://dataseed5.defibit.io:443
```
Example on **testnet**:

```bash
$  ./tbnbcli account bnc1wwgakqy32m7vdnlf00pctf9hnaak37eh7wkmqa --trust-node --chain-id=Binance-Chain-Ganges --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.bnbchain.org:80
{
   "type":"bnbchain/Account",
   "value":{
      "base":{
         "address":"bnc1wwgakqy32m7vdnlf00pctf9hnaak37eh7wkmqa",
         "coins":[
            {
               "denom":"AAA-254",
               "amount":"19500000000000000"
            }
         ],
         "public_key":{
            "type":"tendermint/PubKeySecp256k1",
            "value":"A1V88I61gCbF2V1RqdCxb0UN/8g95mNUlJGH5htNNC70"
         },
         "account_number":"0",
         "sequence":"337"
      },
      "name":"node0",
      "frozen":null,
      "locked":null
   }
}
```
