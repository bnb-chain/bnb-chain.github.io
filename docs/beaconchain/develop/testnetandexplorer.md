### What is a Testnet?

The testnet is a test environment for BNB Chain network, run by the BNB Chain development community, which is open to developers.

The validators on the testnet are from development team.

You can connect a node to the testnet by downloading the node binary and testnet configuration from [https://github.com/bnb-chain/node/releases](https://github.com/bnb-chain/node/releases).

### What is the Testnet good for?

- Create your test address and get your testnet funds.
- Develop applications and try tutorials on BNB Chain without the potential to lose your own assets.
- Test your applications against new versions of BNB Chain.
- Analyze blockchain data on a smaller, non-trivial data set compared to the public network.
