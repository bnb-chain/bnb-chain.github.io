# User Guide of Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) in BNB Beacon Chain 

## Introduction

**Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)** is a cryptographic protocol for distributed key generation and signing. TSS allows constructing a signature that is distributed among different parties (for example three users), and each user receives a share of the private signing key. To sign a transaction, at least two of these three users need to join. For individuals, threshold signatures allow for two-factor security or splitting the ability to sign between two devices so that a single compromised device won’t put the money at risk. For businesses, threshold signatures allow for the realization of access control policies that prevent both insiders and outsiders from stealing corporate funds. TSS technology allows us to replace all signing commands with distributed computations.The private key is no longer a single point of failure.

## Motivation
A physical key must fit exactly into a keyhole to unlock a physical vault. But if this key is compromised or lost, the funds locked in the vault may no longer be safe. This simple approach of key management may make sense when a small sum is at stake. However, when the amount stored in the vault is large, it is wise to consider spreading the responsibility of key ownership between several trusted parties.

Traditional **MultiSig (multi-signature)** is a more refined unlocking system that requires *multiple* independent keys to unlock the vault. MultiSig requires generating a larger private key and the vault has multiple locks - one for each key . More processing power is needed as participants have to sign additional signatures, which must then be checked individually by the network. This is not ideal, because a participant must leave traces showing exactly who signed and multiple parties must be online at the same time.

With **Threshold Signatures**, all of the parties must forge the vault’s lock together, in a modular way, where each party owns a share of the key. A TSS vault is indistinguishable from a regular vault and is hence universal, and it has the same privacy and verification cost of a regular vault. Even if only a subset of the keys is available, the vault may still be unlocked (this is known as meeting a threshold of participation).

Combining TSS feature  with BNB Beacon Chain  client will help users manage their funds in a much safer way. TSS will be offered in an independent binary, but it will have some impact on the existing functions of *bnbcli/tbnbcli*.

## Implementation

Many development resources have been poured into implementing TSS, a cryptographic protocol for distributed key generation and signing. TSS is now compatible and reusable for ECDSA-based blockchains, including BNB Beacon Chain, Bitcoin, and Ethereum networks. We expect that members of the BNB Chain ecosystem and partner community can integrate this TSS library with their applications, such as wallets and custodians, and further develop this exciting new technology.

With the support of the BNB Beacon Chain  community, we are happy to share the open-source code at https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib.

## Security Audit


The implementation of a multi-party threshold ECDSA [library](https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib) is open source so it can be publicly audited by anyone. An independent third party auditors from [Kudelski Security](https://www.kudelskisecurity.com/)  are hired to validate the security of the cryptography in TSS solution. The latest report in October by can be found [here](./assets/audit-binance-tss-lib-final.pdf).

Security checks are routinely and continuously planned for all parts of TSS lib implementations and future audits  will be reported to BNB Beacon Chain  community.

## Workflow
Let’s take a look at the major steps in TSS:

* **Vault Initialization**: the first step is for setting up tss parameters of each party. This will initialize the node's p2p listen address and setup a directory to save key. It's recommended that you should save your tss key in a different folder other than normal key info.

* **Key Generation**: the second step is also the most complex. We need to define the quorum policy: count of total parties (n) that holds secret shares and threshold (t) which means at least t + 1 parties need to take part in the signing process. We need to generate a key which will be public and used to verify future signatures. However, we also have to generate an individual secret for each party, which is called a secret share. The functions guarantee the same public key to all parties and a different secret share for each. In this way, we achieve: (1) privacy: no secret shares data is leaked between any parties, and (2) correctness: the public key is intact with secret share. They need to agree on the channel which they want to use for sending messages between each other. The channel will have its corresponding password. Both ID and password needs to be shared offline.

* **Signing**: this step involves a signature generation function. The input of each party will be its own secret share, created as output of the distributed key generation in the previous step. There is also public input known to all, which is the message to be signed. The output will be a digital signature, and the property of privacy ensures that no leakage of secret shares occurred during the computation.

* **Verification**: the verification algorithm remains as it is in the classical setting. To be compatible with single key signatures, BNB Beacon Chain  validator nodes can be able to verify the signature with the public key. The transaction will be no different from others.

* **Vault Regroup**:  Regroup will reset secret share and configs between all parties.It's recommend to switch the configuration periodically, say once a month. If some party lost his key, it's also necessory to reset the distribution once some party lost their key. Regroup will generate new_n secret share with new_t threshold. At least old_t + 1 should participant

## Changes to `bnbcli/tbnbcli`
We added a new key type “tss” (just like the existing types: “local”, “offline”, “ledger”) to bnbcli which stands for tss secret share.

To add a tss key into bnbcli’s keystore:
1. Tss keygen command will automatically add generated secret share into default keystore (~/.bnbcli) with name `tss_<moniker>_<vault_name>`
2. User can manually specify tss’s home, vault_name and a customized bnbcli home like:
```
bnbcli keys add --home ~/.customized_cli --tss -t tss --tss-home ~/.test1 --tss-vault “default” my_name
```
All other commands (i.e. send token, place order, delete key etc.) of bnbcli should support tss type key.

## Example

In this example, A, B and C are the parties who decided to share a private key together. They decided that any two of them can sign a transaction. To complete a TSS signing process, they need to follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Init TSS

During this step, all parties from different machines have to initialite their P2P settings before generate the shared key.


|                            | A                                                            | B                                                            | C                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| command                    | ./tss init                                                   | ./tss init                                                   | ./tss init                                                   |

| output                     | Local party has been initialized under: <br/>~/.tss/vault1   | Local party has been initialized under: <br/>~/.tss/vault1   | Local party has been initialized under: <br/>~/.tss/vault1   |

### Step 2: Generate Channel ID for bootstraping

In this step, the parties will create a secrect communication channel between them. One of then will generate the channel ID and share with others. In this example, A will generate the channel ID. B and C will not have to do anything. A can also specify the length for this channel session and the default time is 30 mins.

|                   | A                                                            | B    | C    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| command           | ./tss channel                                                | N/A  | N/A  |
| Interactive input | > please set expire time in minutes, (default: 30):<br/>[input time] | N/A  | N/A  |
| output            | channel id: **5185D3EF597**                                  | N/A  | N/A  |


### Step 3: Generate and Share Secret

In this step, the private key will be generated and shared between these three parties. All the parties have to be online at the sme time.

|                            | A                                                            | B                                                            | C                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| command                    | ./tss keygen --vault_name vault1                             | ./tss keygen --vault_name vault1                             | ./tss keygen --vault_name vault1                             |

### Step 4: Sign Transaction

In this steo, A and B decided to sign a transaction together. Both A and B will try to broadcast the transaction and only one of them will succeed.

### Step 5: Regroup Vault

First, please generate a new channel for messaging:

|                   | A                                                            | B    | C    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| command           | ./tss channel                                                | N/A  | N/A  |
| Interactive input | > please set expire time in minutes, (default: 30):<br/>[input time] | N/A  | N/A  |
| output            | channel id: **3415D3FBE00**                                  | N/A  | N/A  |

Then, we can switch to the new channel for sending messages to each others.

1. Change 1-3 into 2-4 scheme.
2. old parties (A, B) join new committee
3. new parties (D, E) are newly-joined
