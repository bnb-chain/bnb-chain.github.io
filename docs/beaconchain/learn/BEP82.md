# BEP82

> Note: this feature is only available in Testnet after Lagrange Upgrade.

## Introduction

Before implementing BEP82, many token-related transactions, such as token listing, minting, burning, can only be proposed by the token owner.  The owner of any BEP2/BEP8  token can not be changed once the token is issued on BNB Beacon Chain .

BEP82 introduced the changes related to the token owner who issued a token on BNB Beacon Chain . It provides more convenience and flexibility for these transactions.

## Status

This BEP is already implemented.

## Changes

BEP82 introduce the following changes:

- Token issuers can renounce their ownership and promote others
- Allows token holders to burn their tokens

## New Transaction Type

**TransferOwnership** transaction can transfer ownership of a specific token to another address, and only the original owner has the permission to send this transaction.

#### Commands

```bash
./bnbcli token transfer-ownership --from  $current-owner --symbol $symbol --new-owner $new-owner  --chain-id Binance-Chain-Tigris   --node  https://dataseed5.defibit.io:443 --trust-node
```
Example on **testnet**:

```bash
./tbnbcli token transfer-ownership --from  $current-owner --symbol $symbol --new-owner $new-owner --chain-id Binance-Chain-Nile  --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80--trust-node
```
