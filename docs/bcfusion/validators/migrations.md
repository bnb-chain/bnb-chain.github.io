# Validator Migration

The [native staking](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP294.md)
enables native staking and validators on the BNB Smart Chain.
To facilitate validator operators migrating their validators created on the Beacon Chain to the BSC,
the [migration tool](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bc-migration-tool) is introduced.
Please follow the [steps](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bc-migration-tool) for the migration.

You can also following the [document](creation.md) for creating new validators using dApp. However, you need to manage
your delegations using commands in the [migration tool](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bc-migration-tool) or
old staking dApp for [cross chain redelegations](../users/stake-migration.md).
