# Asset Management

The BNB Chain community recently introduced [BEP333: BNB Chain
Fusion](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/pull/333). This
BEP aims to retire the BNB Beacon Chain from the BNB Chain ecosystem.
The goal is to enhance the development efficiency, security, and asset
utilization efficiency of BSC. It also aims to reduce the maintenance
costs of legacy services. This tutorial aims to help digital asset
issuers and holders on the BNB Beacon Chain transfer the value of their
assets,
including [BEP2](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP2.md)/[BEP8](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEPs/BEP8.md)
tokens, before and after BC Fusion. By following this guide, users can
avoid any potential losses of their valuable digital assets.

***NOTE: The BC Fusion program is scheduled for implementation in April 2024. Please ensure careful planning for the
asset migration and keep the fund safe.***

## Bind Token

Please check the tutorial [**Confirm if the Assets Support Cross-chain Transfers**](../users/assets.md) to verify if the
token allows cross-chain
transfers. If the answer is positive, congratulations! You don't need
to do anything. Otherwise, it is highly recommended to follow the
[Token Bind Tool
here](https://github.com/bnb-chain/token-bind-tool) to
deploy a BEP20 token on BSC and enable cross-chain functionality.

Due to the time limitation, the Token Issuer should take actions as soon as possbile. It is
recommended that the Token Issuer use multiple channels to promptly
notify asset holders to migrate as soon as possible.

***Note: BEP2/BEP8 assets that do not support cross-chain functionality
will be permanently lost after BC Fusion. Users will be unable to
recover these assets forever.***
