# Oracles
Blockchain oracles are entities that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world. Simply put, oracles provide a mechanism for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access existing data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations.

Following is the list of Data Oracles supported by BNB Chain.

- [**Binance Oracle**](https://oracle.binance.com/): Binance Oracle, a decentralized Web3 Oracle, a data feed network that connects real-world data to blockchain smart contracts. Binance Oracle will enable smart contracts to run on real-world inputs and outputs, starting with the BNB Chain ecosystem. Refer [here](https://oracle.binance.com/docs) for API Reference.
- [**Band Protocol**](https://bandprotocol.com/): Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. Refer [here](https://docs.bandchain.org/) for API Reference.
- [**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/): Securely connect smart contracts with off-chain data and services Chainlink decentralized oracle networks provide tamper-proof inputs, outputs, and computations to support advanced smart contracts on any blockchain. Refer [here](https://docs.chain.link/) for API Reference.
- [**Pyth**](https://pyth.network/): Pyth delivers real-time on-chain market data. Refer [here](https://pyth.network/developers) for API Reference.
- [**DIA**](https://www.diadata.org/): DIA provides customizable oracles tailored to individual dApp requirements, with flexibility in data sources, filters, pricing, and update methods. Drawing trade data from 80+ sources like CEXs, DEXs, and NFT marketplaces, DIA ensures transparency and control. Their product suite includes price feeds for 20,000+ cryptocurrencies, NFTs, LSTs, and more.
