# Oracles
Blockchain oracles are entities that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world. Simply put, oracles provide a mechanism for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access existing data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations.

Following is the list of Data Oracles supported by BNB Chain.

- [**Binance Oracle**](https://oracle.binance.com/): Binance Oracle, a decentralized Web3 Oracle, a data feed network that connects real-world data to blockchain smart contracts. Binance Oracle will enable smart contracts to run on real-world inputs and outputs, starting with the BNB Chain ecosystem. Refer [here](https://oracle.binance.com/docs) for API Reference.
- [**Band Protocol**](https://bandprotocol.com/): Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. Refer [here](https://docs.bandchain.org/) for API Reference.
- [**Chainlink**](https://chain.link/): Securely connect smart contracts with off-chain data and services Chainlink decentralized oracle networks provide tamper-proof inputs, outputs, and computations to support advanced smart contracts on any blockchain. Refer [here](https://docs.chain.link/) for API Reference.
- [**Pyth**](https://pyth.network/): Pyth delivers real-time on-chain market data. Refer [here](https://pyth.network/developers) for API Reference.
- [**DIA**](https://www.diadata.org/): DIA provides customizable oracles tailored to individual dApp requirements, with flexibility in data sources, filters, pricing, and update methods. Drawing trade data from 80+ sources like CEXs, DEXs, and NFT marketplaces, DIA ensures transparency and control. Their product suite includes price feeds for 20,000+ cryptocurrencies, NFTs, LSTs, and more. Refer [here](https://docs.diadata.org/products/token-price-feeds/access-api-endpoints) for API Reference. 
- [**Supra**](https://supraoracles.com/): Supra is a novel, high-throughput Oracle & IntraLayer: A vertically integrated toolkit of cross-chain solutions (data oracles, asset bridges, automation network, and more) that interlink all blockchains, public (L1s and L2s) or private (enterprises). 
Supra provides decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for on-chain and off-chain use-cases such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payments protocols. Supra’s oracle chain and consensus algorithm makes it the fastest-to-finality oracle provider, with layer-1 security guarantees. The pull oracle has a sub-second response time. Aside from speed and security, Supra’s rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and applies a robust calculation methodology to get the most accurate value. The node provenance on the data dashboard also provides a fully transparent historical audit trail. Supra’s Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) paper was accepted into ICDCS 2023, oldest distributed systems conference.
