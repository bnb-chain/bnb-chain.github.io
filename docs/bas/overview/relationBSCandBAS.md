# Relation between BSC and BAS
The BNB Chain ecosystem is comprised of 2 blockchains - the Beacon Chain (BC) and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). BC is the governance layer of the ecosystem whereas, BSC is the financial hub where the actual development comes into action which includes decentralized applications related to DeFi, Metaverse, GameFi, etc.  Over the years, BSC has grown into becoming the developers' favourite blockchain ecosystem for building various powerful decentralized applications that are shaping the Web3 ecosystem. However, with the increase in the network usage and users, network scalability issues are surfacing to overcome this constraints and provide their users with seamless services the BNB Chain team has introduced the BNB Application SideChains (BAS).

BAS is targetted to empower the BSC blockchain through following ways:

* ### **Higher Throughput and Lower Gas Fees** 
To overcome network scalability problems of BSC, the BSC community has proposed the use of BAS in their [Outlook 2022](https://www.bnbchain.world/en/blog/bsc-2022-build-and-build/) paper. These sidechains are designed for much higher throughput and lower (even zero) gas fees. 

* ### **Seamless Integration** 
We have defined protocol for consensus management and messaging between BAS and BSC so that it is easier for developers to use a ready-made solution and it is easier for BSC to integrate with them. The idea of BAS is to allow you to expand and reuse existing modules, and by using the architecture on smart contracts, painlessly modify existing contracts. 

* ### **Ready-to-Use Solutions**
BAS is a framework for creating sidechains in the BSC ecosystem. It is an infrastructure to help developers and node operators build and run their own blockchains as their internal value system and for a massive number of users while still maintaining a close connection with the BSC. 
The main task of BAS is to facilitate any project developer to be able to deploy their own blockchains with their unique specifications and validator set (currently, BNB Chain validators are used for consensus) but still be connected to the BSC infrastructure. The validator set can run with fewer validators than BNB Chain, depending on the BAS deployer. These validators can be run by the application owners or any community stakeholders, bringing more flexibility and decentralization to BAS.

* ### **Extend Existing Functionality of BSC**
We can rightfully claim that BAS is a lightweight framework on which one can build simple but functional blockchain projects. Developers and teams can create simple blockchains with their own business rules and economies. Most importantly, they can extend the existing functionality of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC).
