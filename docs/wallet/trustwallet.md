# Using Trust Wallet for BNB Smart Chain

## What is Trust Wallet?
Trust Wallet (trustwallet.com) is a self-custodial wallet that is secure, open source and decentralized. It is a multi-chain wallet that allows you to store and manage over 6 million crypto assets including NFTs across 69 blockchains. Seeing significant user adoption since its launch in November 2017. The company has built a reputation for security and has held itself to the guiding principles that it will never access user wallets, hold private keys, and ask for personal information.
