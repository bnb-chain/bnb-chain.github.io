One thing to remember here is that Solana uses the RUST programming language for writing smart contracts. Whereas, smart contracts in BSC are usually written in the Solidity programming language. This language incompatibility means that either you would have to re-write your smart contract in Solidity from scratch or use rust-compatible EVM solutions on BSC for running rust-based smart contracts."),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"migrating-vesting-tokens"},"Migrating Vesting Tokens"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"As both Solana and BSC have completely different token standards, even though the tokens can be bridged, a better approach is to mint new tokens on the BSC.
